# Experimental FAF Patchnotes

This project aims to revive the old site that many users loved by converting it to a Jekyll-based solution. The goal is to enhance usability and simplify the process of creating patch notes for balance updates.

## Home  
The home screen will be completely redesigned with the following features:  
- A seamless header across all pages  
- Search functionality for finding patches  
- Display of the last three patches on the homepage  
- A consistent footer on all pages  

## Posts  

Each patch notes page will be converted into a post, allowing for improved formatting and additional metadata. This includes adding dates, tags, and other relevant details using Jekyllâ€™s blog-style content structure.
