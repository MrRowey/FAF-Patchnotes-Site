# **Experimental FAF Patch Notes**

This project aims to **revive and modernize** the old patch notes site that many users loved by transitioning to a **Jekyll-based solution**. The goal is to **enhance usability**, provide a **clean and structured layout**, and **streamline the process** of creating, updating, and maintaining patch notes for balance updates.

## **Key Objectives**

âœ” **User-Friendly Interface** â€“ A refreshed and intuitive design for improved navigation.  
âœ” **Search & Filtering** â€“ Quick and efficient ways to find specific patches.  
âœ” **Seamless Experience** â€“ A consistent design across all pages.  
âœ” **Automation & Simplicity** â€“ Easier patch note creation using Jekyllâ€™s templating system.

## **Patch Notes as Posts**

Each patch notes page will be structured as an **individual post**, allowing for:

- **Improved Formatting** â€“ Clear sections, bold headers, and markdown-friendly content.
