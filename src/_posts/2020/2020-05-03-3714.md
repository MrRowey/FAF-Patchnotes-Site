Land
----

### ![](/assets/images/units/aeon/land/T1Tank.png) Aurora

The Aurora will now use the firing solution instead of its aim bone when targeting units. This should decrease the number of initial shots that miss.

### ![](/assets/images/units/aeon/land/T2Tank.png) Obsidian

The obsidian's damage and rate of fire are adjusted. This is a general improvement aimed at increasing their efficiency versus T1 units and reducing the downside of a missed shot.

*   Damage: 480 360
*   RateOfFire: 0.25 0.333

### ![](/assets/images/units/uef/land/T2Tank.png) Pillar

The pillar gets a slight range reduction to allow for more micro and kiting in some matchups, notably versus the rhino.

*   Range: 23 22

### ![](/assets/images/units/cybran/land/T2Tank.png) Rhino

The rhino gets a range increase of one to differentiate the ranges of the main T2 tanks more greatly, allowing for more micro and kiting.

*   Mass Cost: 297 290
*   Build Time: 1320 1300
*   Range: 23 24
*   Vision Radius: 20 22

### ![](/assets/images/units/sera/land/T2Tank.png) Ilshavoh

The Ilshavoh has improved micro capabilities thanks to an increase in turret turn speed. Vision radius is increased to reduce their reliance on selens and radars.

*   FiringTolerance: 1 3
*   TurretYawSpeed: 70 85
*   Vision Radius: 20 24

### ![](/assets/images/units/uef/land/T2HoverTank.png) Riptide

The riptide was the weakest T2 tank after the recent Blaze buff. It gets a substantial buff to bring it closer in strength to other T2 units.

*   Health: 1700 1800
*   Mass Cost: 360 320
*   Power Cost: 2000 1650
*   Build Time: 1600 1420

### ![](/assets/images/units/aeon/land/T2HoverTank.png) Blaze

The blaze gets a small buff to its health and range to differentiate from other hover tanks.

*   Health: 1050 1100
*   Range: 23 24

### ![](/assets/images/units/sera/land/T2HoverTank.png) Yenzyne

The Yenzyne is given greater health and a faster fire rate with a decrease in speed to improve its effectiveness on land without over buffing it in the naval arena.

*   Health: 1300 1350
*   Speed: 4.3 4
*   RateOfFire: 0.25 0.3

### Mobile Bomb

### ![](/assets/images/units/cybran/land/T2MobileBomb.png) Fire beetles

Fire beetles are now cheaper, faster to build and have less health. Fire beetles are permanently cloaked, meaning they must be spotted using radar and cannot be spotted using a units vision.

*   Health: 500 350
*   Mass Cost: 250 190
*   Power Cost: 1500 1300
*   Build Time: 1000 700
*   Damage: 1500 1100
*   Fire beetles can now cloak.

### T3 Light Assault Bots

### ![](/assets/images/units/uef/land/T3Bot.png) Titan

Titans get a buff in range, and small health and shield buffs. Damage is reduced slightly to prevent over buffing.

*   Health: 2550 2600
*   Shield: 600 700
*   Damage: 50 45
*   Recharge Time: 15 12
*   Range: 22 24

### ![](/assets/images/units/cybran/land/T3AssultBot.png) Loyalist

The Loyalist gains damage and range at the expense of health. It also gains a new ability called "Charge." When activated, a ten second countdown begins and the Loyalist will self-destruct at the end of that countdown. After four seconds the Loyalist gains a x1.75 speed boost and its stun duration is doubled. The delay between pressing the charge button and gaining these advantages is to stop players from simply enabling the ability as any Loyalist is about to die. Once the charge starts after 4 seconds a timer appears over the head of the Loyalist. At the end of the countdown the loyalist will explode. The aim of the new ability is to accentuate the death weapon of the Loyalist and allow for new gameplay opportunities.

*   Health: 3000 2500

EMP explosion on death:*   Duration: 1.4s 1.5s

2nd Weapon (Heavy Electron Bolter):*   Damage: 14 28
*   Range: 20 24

Charge ability:*   Stun duration when charging: 3

### ![](/assets/images/units/aeon/land/T3Tank.png) Harbinger

Harbingers get a significant buff, gaining a small amount of range to allow for more micro possibilities while also gaining some health and a fast shield recharge speed. Their fire cycle is also adjusted.

*   Health: 3050 3600
*   Range: 26 27
*   Damage: 320 160
*   RateOfFire: 1 2

### ![](/assets/images/units/sera/land/T3Tank.png) Othuum

*   Health: 5000 4700
*   Unit Size:

*   Speed: 2.6 2.75
*   SizeY: 0.45 0.65

Structures
----------

### ![](/assets/images/units/aeon/structure/T2AirFactoryHQ.png) T2 Air HQ
