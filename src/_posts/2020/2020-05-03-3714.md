Patch 3714 BETA

# Patch 3714

#### Date: _May 3rd 2020_

This patch primarily aims to improve the land balance between factions and between different unit choices at the T2 and T3 stages.  
We wish you good luck and much fun playing with the new patch!

## Land

### ![](/assets/images/units/aeon/land/T1Tank.png) Aurora

The Aurora will now use the firing solution instead of its aim bone when targeting units. This should decrease the number of initial shots that miss.

### ![](/assets/images/units/aeon/land/T2Tank.png) Obsidian

The obsidian's damage and rate of fire are adjusted. This is a general improvement aimed at increasing their efficiency versus T1 units and reducing the downside of a missed shot.

- Damage: 480 <span class="material-symbols-outlined">
  arrow_forward
  </span> 360
- RateOfFire: 0.25 <span class="material-symbols-outlined">
  arrow_forward
  </span> 0.333

### ![](/assets/images/units/uef/land/T2Tank.png) Pillar

The pillar gets a slight range reduction to allow for more micro and kiting in some matchups, notably versus the rhino.

- Range: 23 <span class="material-symbols-outlined">
  arrow_forward
  </span> 22

### ![](/assets/images/units/cybran/land/T2Tank.png) Rhino

The rhino gets a range increase of one to differentiate the ranges of the main T2 tanks more greatly, allowing for more micro and kiting.

- Mass Cost: 297 <span class="material-symbols-outlined">

  arrow_forward
  </span> 22

### ![](/assets/images/units/sera/land/T2Tank.png) Ilshavoh

The Ilshavoh has improved micro capabilities thanks to an increase in turret turn speed. Vision radius is increased to reduce their reliance on selens and radars.

- FiringTolerance: 1 <span class="material-symbols-outlined">
  arrow_forward
  </span> 3
- TurretYawSpeed: 70 <span class="material-symbols-outlined">

### Mobile Bomb

### ![](/assets/images/units/cybran/land/T2MobileBomb.png) Fire beetles

Fire beetles are now cheaper, faster to build and have less health. Fire beetles are permanently cloaked, meaning they must be spotted using radar and cannot be spotted using a units vision.

- Health: 500 <span class="material-symbols-outlined">
  arrow_forward
  </span> 350
- Mass Cost: 250 <span class="material-symbols-outlined">

Titans get a buff in range, and small health and shield buffs. Damage is reduced slightly to prevent over buffing.

- Health: 2550 <span class="material-symbols-outlined">

### ![](/assets/images/units/cybran/land/T3AssultBot.png) Loyalist

The Loyalist gains damage and range at the expense of health. It also gains a new ability called "Charge." When activated, a ten second countdown begins and the Loyalist will self-destruct at the end of that countdown. After four seconds the Loyalist gains a x1.75 speed boost and its stun duration is doubled. The delay between pressing the charge button and gaining these advantages is to stop players from simply enabling the ability as any Loyalist is about to die. Once the charge starts after 4 seconds a timer appears over the head of the Loyalist. At the end of the countdown the loyalist will explode. The aim of the new ability is to accentuate the death weapon of the Loyalist and allow for new gameplay opportunities.

- Health: 3000 <span class="material-symbols-outlined">

### Tech 3 Mobile Artillery

Tech 3 artillery became a strong option versus tech 3 tanks after the tech 3 land health reduction. These changes are designed to prevent them from so easily being used against massed tech 3 and tech 2. They will have a harder time retreating from armies.

## Structures

### ![](/assets/images/units/aeon/structure/T2AirFactoryHQ.png) T2 Air HQ

The lower cost of the T2 Air HQ compared to land and navy led to a T2 air rush being a no-brainer on 20x20 1v1 maps.
