Patch 3718

# Patch 3718

#### Date: _November 29th 2020_

This patch aims to increase the power of early attacking options through buffs to tech 1 bombers and labs. It also aims to align the strength of tech one tanks more closely through adjustments to aurora and mantis.  
Tech two mobile shields and range bots get a slight nerf. Overcharge now operates at a fixed energy cost per damage with a ratio of 1:4 damage to energy. A minimum of 5k energy is required.  
We wish you good luck and much fun playing with the new patch!
