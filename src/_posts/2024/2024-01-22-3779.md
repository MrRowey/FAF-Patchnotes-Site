Land
----

### ![](/assets/images/units/uef/land/T3Tank.png)Percival

*   The Percival now prioritizes firing at structures over tech 1 units. Its targeting priorities are now similar to Snipers.

### ![](/assets/images/units/cybran/land/T3AssultBot.png)Loyalist

The deflector weapon of the Loyalist allows it to take ownership of incoming tactical missiles and return them to the unit that fired it. With the new implementation the missiles that are send back have switched army and can therefore be intercepted by Tactical Missile Defenses (TMDs) and shields.

The deflector weapon can now deflect the Billy again.

The deflector weapon is unable to deflect tactical missiles that are incoming from directly above the Loyalist.

### ![](/assets/images/units/sera/land/T3Sniper.png)Sera Sniper

Adjust the movement behavior of the Seraphim sniper. The movement reduction of the sniper mode is now only applied when the main weapon is on cooldown. This reduces the amount of micro that is required to use the sniper.

Navy
----

### ![](/assets/images/units/cybran/naval/T2Cruiser.png)Cruiser

The Cybran Cruiser is now equipped with a Deflector instead of a Zapper. The deflector weapon is unable to deflect tactical missiles that are incoming from directly above the Cybran Cruiser.

### ![](/assets/images/units/sera/naval/T3SubHunter.png)Sub-Hunter

*   MuzzleSalvoDelay: 1 0.7

### ![](/assets/images/units/cybran/naval/T3AircraftCarrier.png)Aircraft Carrier

The Cybran Aircraft Carrier is now equipped with a Deflector instead of a Zapper. The deflector weapon is unable to deflect tactical missiles that are incoming from directly above the Cybran Aircraft Carrier.

ACU/SCUs
--------

### ![](/assets/images/Enhancements/uef/teleport.png)UEF ACU Teleport

There was an unforeseen strategy that one can apply when teleporting a UEF ACU with a Billy. The Billy enhancement now occupies the same slot as the teleport enhancement again.

*   Upgrade Slot: Left Back

### ![](/assets/images/Enhancements/uef/billy.png)Adjust the behavior of the Billy.

The Billy no longer explodes in the first 2.5 seconds of its lifespan. The damage of the Billy no longer pierces shields, reversing an accidental change.

### ![](/assets/images/units/sera/land/SCU.png)Seraphim SCU

Buff standard resource allocation of Seraphim SACUs

Increased standard resource production to 3 mass/second and 200 energy/second for Seraphim SACUs.

The Seraphim faction lacks a Resource Allocation Subsystem (RAS) for the SACU. We understand that players may feel disadvantaged when playing Seraphim in the very-late game phase where RAS SACUs can play an important role. With these changes, we preserve the faction diversity while providing the Seraphim faction with an alternative approach to generate mobile resources.

Structure
---------

### ![](/assets/images/units/aeon/structure/T4Optics.png)Eye of Rhianne

Modify the economy behavior of the Scry ability of the Eye of Rhianne. Now behaves similarly to other economy-consuming abilities.

### ![](/assets/images/units/uef/structure/T3PointDef.png)Ravager

Remove the friendly fire of the Ravager.
