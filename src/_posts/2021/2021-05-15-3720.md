Patch 3720

# Patch 3720

#### Date: _May 15th 2021_

This patch is a combination of small fine-tuning and changes to game mechanics. It's a relatively small patch stabilizing the balance and getting things out of the way so that the focus can (hopefully) be shifted towards SCUs going forward.  
Selen, Jester and Bombers are all getting small buffs as a follow-up to previous patch. Mantis icon is changed from a LAB icon to a tank icon as this became an apparent issue with the resurgence of LAB usage after their buff. Shard will now actually hit stuff. Mex build time and build power are reverted to pre-engymod values, making them more efficient to assist and making the choice between using engineers for reclaim and assist more meaningful. Target priorities have been fine-tuned from the last change. Overcharge now kills a mobile shield generator if it depletes its shield.  
We wish you good luck and much fun playing with the new patch!
