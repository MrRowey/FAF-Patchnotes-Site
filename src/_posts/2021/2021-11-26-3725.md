  Patch 3725 

Patch 3725
==========

#### Date: _November 26th 2021_

This patch touches various land, naval and air units as well as reworks a couple of ACU upgrades. Notably seraphim are receiving significant nerfs to Selen cloak and Zthuee build time efficiency while cybran are getting some buffs that will make their mid-game a lot more robust. Plus various QoL improvements and fixes to inconsistent unit behavior.

### \-- The Balance Team

* * *

Land
----

### ![](/assets/images/units/sera/land/T1MobileArty.png) Zthuee

Zthuee are more efficient BP-wise for their strength compared to other T1 arties which allows for powerful arty spam with a rather small investment in factories. This brings them more in line with other factions.

*   BuildTime: 180 270

### Tech 3 Light Assault Bots

This is a small buff to the Titan and the Loyalist bringing their E and BT costs more in line with other T3 units which should make massing them a bit easier, potentially prolonging the T3 light bot stage before bricks and percival's come out.

### ![](/assets/images/units/uef/land/T3Bot.png)Titan

*   BuildCostEnergy: 5400 5250
*   BuildTime: 2400 2160

### ![](/assets/images/units/cybran/land/T3AssultBot.png)Loyalist

*   BuildCostEnergy: 5400 5250
*   BuildTime: 2400 2160

Allows loyalists to better deal with T2 which is the main threat during early T3 stage.

*   Add 1.5s stun to the slow-firing weapon affecting units up to and including T2, excluding navy and structures

### Tech 1 Land Scouts

Make scouts slightly more appealing to create early game and help the scouts to not aggro on enemy units and civilians from far away when they are given an attack move or an assist order.

![](/assets/images/units/uef/land/T1Scout.png)**UEF Scout (Snoop)**

*   Reduce the aggro range while on assist/attack move
*   BuildTime: 80 60

![](/assets/images/units/cybran/land/T1Scout.png)**Cybran Scout (Mole)**

*   BuildCostEnergy: 80 60
*   EnergyMaintenanceCost: 5 1
*   Reduce the aggro range while on assist/attack move
*   BuildTime: 80 60

![](/assets/images/units/aeon/land/T1Scout.png)**Aeon Scout (Spirit)**

*   BuildCostEnergy: 40 60
*   Reduce the aggro range while on assist/attack move
*   BuildTime: 80 60

![](/assets/images/units/sera/land/T1Scout.png)**Seraphim Scout (Selen)**

*   Reduce the aggro range while on assist/attack move
*   BuildTime: 80 60
*   Energy Maintenance Cost: 0 1
*   StealthWaitTime: 1 3
*   Vision and radar range are now multiplied by 0.6 when entering cloak mode

Drastically reduce the abusiveness of cloaked selen both in the early game with the reduced radar as well as in the mid game with energy maintenance cost.

### ![](/assets/images/units/aeon/land/T1LightAssultBot.png) LABs

Allow for more reliable hitting of unmicroed labs moving at an angle.

*   Slightly increase the hitbox

### ![](/assets/images/units/cybran/land/T2MobileBomb.png) Fire beetles

Slightly increase maneuverability to compensate for pathfinding, slightly increase the explosion radius and buff hp to 400 for slightly more survivability, notably allowing it to survive an obsidian shot. Make the beetle come close before detonating if it is manually ordered to attack a unit, before it would detonate at max range and miss a lot of potential damage, now it either detonates up close or gets killed before that and detonates closer than before anyway. Added an extra range ring to indicate the detonation trigger radius.

*   HP: 350 400
*   ExplosionRadius: 6 6.5
*   MaxAcceleration: 5 7
*   TurnRate: 160 200
*   Reduce detonation trigger distance when manually attacking a unit

### ![](/assets/images/units/cybran/land/T2Tank.png) Rhino

*   Revert the weapon from a beam-type to a projectile-type to prevent misses when leading targets

Air
---

### ![](/assets/images/units/aeon/air/T1Transport.png) T1 Transports

*   Add dummy weapons to T1 transports which allows LABs inside the transport to focus fire targets

### ![](/assets/images/units/uef/air/T1Bommber.png) Scorcher

Scorcher’s drop pattern allows it to sometimes kill engies even if enemy manages to partially dodge. These changes convert some of the bomb’s initial damage to damage over time as well as make the drop pattern tighter resulting in a smaller spread of the bombs thus not allowing the last two of them to home in on an engie that had already started to dodge.

*   Damage: 4 4.5
*   InitialDamage: 47.5 42.5
*   MuzzleSalvoDelay: 0.3 0.2

### ![](/assets/images/units/sera/air/T2FighterBomber.png) Notha

Make shooting nothas down easier as they could be extremely difficult to deal with if you lose air control.

*   HP: 1175 1000

### ![](/assets/images/units/cybran/air/T4Gunship.png) Soul Ripper

After the numerous veterancy changes as well as experimental BT changes soul ripper has lost most of its strength, this will allow it to rotate around the map easier and be more effective at harassing and sniping.

*   Add Stealth at -600 energy maintenance cost

### Strategic Bombers

Reduce the snowball effect from early strat bomber rushes killing mass extractors continuously and regaining any hp lost, making it very difficult to kill them if you don't have air control.

 **![](/assets/images/units/cybran/air/T3Strat.png) Revenant**

*   DamageRadius: 7 6.5
*   EnergyMaintenanceCost: 65 150
*   Double the amount of mass killed required to vet

 **![](/assets/images/units/aeon/air/T3Strat.png) Shocker**

*   Damage: 3450 3000
*   DamageRadius: 4 5.25
*   Added a 3s stun of units up to and including T3
*   Double the amount of mass killed required to vet

 **![](/assets/images/units/sera/air/T3Strat.png) Sinntha**

*   Damage: 3250 3000
*   DamageRadius: 5 6
*   Double the amount of mass killed required to vet

 **![](/assets/images/units/uef/air/T3Strat.png) Ambassador**

*   Damage: 3000 3100
*   DamageRadius: 6 5.5
*   Double the amount of mass killed required to vet

### ![](/assets/images/units/aeon/air/T1Bomber.png) Shimmer

*   Better match the EMP radius to the damage radius

### ![](/assets/images/units/cybran/air/T1Gunship.png) Jester

Now jester should be able to hit all or at least most targets consistently.

*   Fix the bug where it would not do damage to moving units
*   Replace splash damage with soft projectile homing

Navy
----

### Tech 2 Destroyer

**![](/assets/images/units/uef/naval/T2Destroyer.png)UEF**

Improve handling and micro potential, slightly improve effectiveness vs submarines.

*   TurretYawRange: 140 160
*   TurretYawSpeed: 90 100
*   Torpedo firing cycle adjusted to combat torpedo defense better

**![](/assets/images/units/cybran/naval/T2Destoryer.png)Cybran**

Make it slightly less punishing to have to retreat your navy.

*   TurretYawRange: 135 140

**![](/assets/images/units/aeon/naval/T2Destroyer.png)Aeon**

Slightly reduce the micro potential to soften the snowball effect that can occur with aeon destroyers.

*   TurretYawRange: 160 150
*   TurretYawSpeed: 100 90

**![](/assets/images/units/sera/naval/T2Destroyer.png)Seraphim**

*   Torpedo firing cycle adjusted to combat torpedo defense better

### ![](/assets/images/units/uef/naval/T4AircraftCarrier.png) Atlantis

*   Fix the AA behaving in a way inconsistent with the stats, adjust the stats to preserve the current balance

Structures
----------

### ![](/assets/images/units/uef/air/T2KennelDrone.png) Kennel Drones

*   Now have higher selection priority than buildings

### ![](/assets/images/units/uef/structure/T3Sonar.png) UEF T3 Sonar

*   Add Jamming

### ![](/assets/images/units/aeon/structure/T4ResorceGenerator.png) Paragon

This will prevent the bug where despite not draining more E than paragon provides you still go into stall and drop shields.

*   Add a 100,000 E storage

### ![](/assets/images/units/aeon/structure/T1PointDefence.png) T1 PDs

*   Adjust the hitboxes and bones of the PDs to make the wall-pd template behave the same way for each faction

### ![](/assets/images/units/uef/structure/T4StaticArty.png) T4 Artilleries

This makes all T4 arties viable for all 3 people who play 81x81 maps.

*   Ranges normalized to 4000 (Mavor range)

ACUs
----

### ![](/assets/images/Enhancements/cybran/stealth.png)Cybran ACU Stealth Upgrade

Gives cybran acu better chances in mid-game against ACUs that can have both T2 and gun at the same time.

*   EnergyCost: 5000 14000
*   MassCost: 350 650
*   BuildTime: 500 800
*   Provides 2000 extra HP

### ![](/assets/images/Enhancements/sera/advancedregenfield.png)Sera ACU Regen Field Upgrade

This boosts the upgrade's attractiveness over the T2 upgrade and also fixes some inconsistencies where some units were getting more regen from the first upgrade tier than the second.

*   Now provides regen to the ACU itself, 10 hp/s for the first upgrade and 20 hp/s for the second
*   Now uses different regen floor values for units depending on their tier:
    
    Basic Tier
    
    *   RegenFloorT1: 3
    *   RegenFloorT2: 8
    *   RegenFloorT3: 15
    *   RegenFloorT4: 25
    *   RegenFloorSCU: 15
    
    Advanced Tier
    
    *   RegenFloorT1: 15
    *   RegenFloorT2: 30
    *   RegenFloorT3: 60
    *   RegenFloorT4: 120
    *   RegenFloorSCU: 80
