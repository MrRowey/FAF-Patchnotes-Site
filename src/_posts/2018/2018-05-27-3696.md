Patch 3696

# Patch 3696

#### Date: _May 26th 2018_

There are four main portions to this balance patch. First is the nerf to direct fire T3 Land units. Second is the rebalance of ACU combat upgrades. Third is the increase in Experimental Unit build times and fourth is an overcharge rework. A T3 land rebalance has been promised for a very long time so we are very happy to finally be at the beta stage for this important development in Forged Alliance. The aim is to allow a larger window on a large number of maps for the T2 land stage. It is potentially one of the most interesting stages of the game, with many different unit compositions and matchups coming into play, but for a long time it has been a very short stage of gameplay because of the effectiveness of T3 land and the effectiveness of commanders.  
The balance team found it necessary to introduce combat ACU upgrade changes, an overcharge rework and Experimental build time increases with the T3 land rebalance. Combat ACU upgrades have been shown to be very strong recently, becoming a staple of teamgames. Some of these upgrades are too dominant and with the T3 land changes, some nerfs are required to prevent the ACU from being too powerful.  
With the delays this patch has faced, other smaller issues have been admitted into this patch as they were deemed important. The most notable of these are the addition of a delay to teleport, a nerf of shield boats and several other changes listed below.

### ![](/assets/images/units/uef/land/T1MobileAA.png) T1 Mobile Anti Air

T1 MAA gets a small damage reduction and mass cost reduction so it doesn't cost more than tanks anymore. Sera MAA is fixed so that is does its intended damage.

Aeon:

### ![](/assets/images/units/cybran/land/T2MobileBomb.png) Fire Beetle:

Fire beetles are getting a much needed rebalance to encourage their use within armies.

- Damage: 3500 <span class="material-symbols-outlined">

### ![](/assets/images/units/aeon/land/T3Tank.png) Harbinger:

The Harbinger rebalance puts more focus on the shield. The shield accounts for more of the total hp will regen and recharge much more quickly than before. This emphasizes the micro capabilities of the Harb, allowing for more hit and run combat tactics.

- BuildTime: 4500 <span class="material-symbols-outlined">

### ![](/assets/images/units/sera/land/T3Tank.png) Othuum:

More emphasis is put on the longer range high alpha damage weapon of the Othuum and its target priorities have been fixed to be in line with other T3 tanks.

- Health: 6700 <span class="material-symbols-outlined">
  arrow_forward
  </span> 5000
- Acceleration: 2.6 <span class="material-symbols-outlined">

Torpedo Weapon:

- Range: 32 <span class="material-symbols-outlined">
  arrow_forward
  </span> 28
- Target Priorities:
  - Othuum now priorities T3 over T2 over T1 instead of the reverse.

### ![](/assets/images/units/uef/land/T3Tank.png) Percival:

The Percival now has the longest range of the T3 tanks and bots so kiting is now very important, even against Bricks. A turret yaw speed increase and slight muzzle velocity increase enables better micro capabilities.

- Health: 9300 <span class="material-symbols-outlined">
  arrow_forward
  </span> 7200
- BuildTime: 6000 <span class="material-symbols-outlined">

- DPS: 400 <span class="material-symbols-outlined">
  arrow_forward
  </span> 334

### ![](/assets/images/units/cybran/land/T3Tank.png) Brick:

The brick now has slightly less range than a Percy but gains speed, turn rate and muzzle velocity to allow for better micro.

- Health: 9000 <span class="material-symbols-outlined">
  arrow_forward
  </span> 7500
- BuildTime: 6000 <span class="material-symbols-outlined">
  arrow_forward

### ![](/assets/images/units/uef/land/T3Tank.png) Titan:

The titan has a smaller health shield but this regens very quickly, sometimes even during the course of a battle if you can keep them alive. It's target priorities are also fixed as with the Othuum.

- Health: 2200 <span class="material-symbols-outlined">
  arrow_forward
  </span> 2550
- Speed: 4 <span class="material-symbols-outlined">

### ![](/assets/images/units/aeon/land/T3Sniper.png) Sprite Striker:

The aeon sniper is better able to shoot while moving and has a higher rate of fire in exchange for less speed and a higher cost.

### ![](/assets/images/units/sera/land/T3Sniper.png) Usha-Ah:

### ![](/assets/images/units/aeon/land/T3MobileArty.png) T3 Mobile Artillery:

Build time is reduced for T3 mobile artillery.

- Build Time: 4800 <span class="material-symbols-outlined">
  arrow_forward
  </span> 4300

### Experimentals

Experimentals have had very low build times which often made thoughtless mass sinks. With the T3 land nerf Experimentals will be a stronger force on the battlefield so build time is increased to compensate for this and to make XPs less of a cheese weapon thrown up in very short periods of time with little build power.
