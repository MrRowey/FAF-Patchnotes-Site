   Patch 3696 

Patch 3696
==========

#### Date: _May 26th 2018_

There are four main portions to this balance patch. First is the nerf to direct fire T3 Land units. Second is the rebalance of ACU combat upgrades. Third is the increase in Experimental Unit build times and fourth is an overcharge rework. A T3 land rebalance has been promised for a very long time so we are very happy to finally be at the beta stage for this important development in Forged Alliance. The aim is to allow a larger window on a large number of maps for the T2 land stage. It is potentially one of the most interesting stages of the game, with many different unit compositions and matchups coming into play, but for a long time it has been a very short stage of gameplay because of the effectiveness of T3 land and the effectiveness of commanders.  
The balance team found it necessary to introduce combat ACU upgrade changes, an overcharge rework and Experimental build time increases with the T3 land rebalance. Combat ACU upgrades have been shown to be very strong recently, becoming a staple of teamgames. Some of these upgrades are too dominant and with the T3 land changes, some nerfs are required to prevent the ACU from being too powerful.  
With the delays this patch has faced, other smaller issues have been admitted into this patch as they were deemed important. The most notable of these are the addition of a delay to teleport, a nerf of shield boats and several other changes listed below.

### \- The Balance Team

* * *

Land
----

### ![](/assets/images/units/sera/land/T1Scout.png) Selen

Removed the Power drain from the stealth/cloak ability while not moving.

### ![](/assets/images/units/aeon/land/T1Tank.png) Aurora

*   FiringRandomnessWhileMoving: 0.3 0.1
*   MuzzleVelocity: 30 25

### ![](/assets/images/units/uef/land/T1MobileAA.png) T1 Mobile Anti Air

T1 MAA gets a small damage reduction and mass cost reduction so it doesn't cost more than tanks anymore. Sera MAA is fixed so that is does its intended damage.

Aeon:*   Mass Cost: 55 50
*   Damage: 10 8
  
UEF:*   Mass Cost: 55 50
*   Damage: 16 14
  
Seraphim:*   Mass Cost: 55 50
*   Damage: 8 14
Cybran:*   Mass Cost: 55 50
*   Damage: 10 9

### ![](/assets/images/units/cybran/land/T2MobileBomb.png) Fire Beetle:

Fire beetles are getting a much needed rebalance to encourage their use within armies.

*   Damage: 3500 1500
*   AoE: 4.5 6
*   Transport class: 2 1
*   Stun ability added. Duration 2s. Stuns all units except Experimentals
*   Friendly Fire Disabled
*   Health: 300 500

### ![](/assets/images/units/aeon/land/T3Tank.png) Harbinger:

The Harbinger rebalance puts more focus on the shield. The shield accounts for more of the total hp will regen and recharge much more quickly than before. This emphasizes the micro capabilities of the Harb, allowing for more hit and run combat tactics.

*   BuildTime: 4500 3600
*   Health: 4600 3050
*   Speed: 3 2.85
*   Acceleration: 3 3.2
*   Turn Rate: 120 130
*   Shield

*   Shield Health: 1300 1000
*   Shield Regen Rate: 9 30
*   Shield Recharge Time: 63 40
*   ShieldRegenStartTime: 3 2
*   Power Drain: 25 30

*   Weapon

*   Damage: 300 320
*   Rate of Fire: 1.25 1
*   Range: 28 26
*   DPS: 375 320
*   Muzzle Velocity: 30 40

### ![](/assets/images/units/sera/land/T3Tank.png) Othuum:

More emphasis is put on the longer range high alpha damage weapon of the Othuum and its target priorities have been fixed to be in line with other T3 tanks.

*   Health: 6700 5000
*   Acceleration: 2.6 3.5
*   SizeY: 0.45 0.65
*   SizeZ: 2.0 2.3
*   First 2 Guns

*   Damage: 75 39
*   Muzzle Velocity: 35 40
*   Turret Yaw Speed: 90 120
*   Combined DPS: 300 156

*   3rd Gun:

*   Damage: 400 525
*   Range: 32 28
*   Muzzle Velocity: 30 40
*   DPS: 100 131

*   Torpedo Weapon:

*   Range: 32 28

*   Target Priorities:

*   Othuum now priorities T3 over T2 over T1 instead of the reverse.

### ![](/assets/images/units/uef/land/T3Tank.png) Percival:

The Percival now has the longest range of the T3 tanks and bots so kiting is now very important, even against Bricks. A turret yaw speed increase and slight muzzle velocity increase enables better micro capabilities.

*   Health: 9300 7200
*   BuildTime: 6000 4800
*   Speed: 2 2.1
*   Acceleration: 2.1
*   TurnRate: 60 70
*   Weapon

*   Damage: 1600 1670
*   Rate of Fire: 0.25 0.2
*   Range: 35 34
*   Muzzle Velocity: 35 38
*   Turret Yaw Speed: 60 90
*   DPS: 400 334

### ![](/assets/images/units/cybran/land/T3Tank.png) Brick:

The brick now has slightly less range than a Percy but gains speed, turn rate and muzzle velocity to allow for better micro.

*   Health: 9000 7500
*   BuildTime: 6000 4800
*   Speed: 2 2.3
*   Acceleration: 2 2.3
*   TurnRate: 60 65
*   Main Weapon:

*   Damage: 150 125
*   Range: 35 32
*   MuzzleVelocity: 35 42
*   Turret Yaw Speed: 60 90
*   DPS: 375 312.5

* * *

### ![](/assets/images/units/uef/land/T3Tank.png) Titan:

The titan has a smaller health shield but this regens very quickly, sometimes even during the course of a battle if you can keep them alive. It's target priorities are also fixed as with the Othuum.

*   Health: 2200 2550
*   Speed: 4 3.8
*   Acceleration: 4 4.2
*   Shield

*   Shield: 1200 600
*   Recharge Time: 60 15
*   Regen Rate: 9 20

*   Range: 20 22
*   Muzzle Velocity: 30 35
*   Turn rate: 150 120

*   Target Priorities:

*   Titan now priorities T3 over T2 over T1 instead of the reverse.

### ![](/assets/images/units/cybran/land/T3AssultBot.png) Loyalist:

The Loyalist gets a small nerf to many stats, and its stun will no longer affect Experimentals and ACUs.

*   Health: 3100 3000
*   Speed: 4 3.8
*   Acceleration: 4 4.2
*   EMP explosion on death:

*   Duration: 2s 1.4s
*   Affected by Stun: Mobile Units Mobile Units - except for T4 and ACUs

*   1st Weapon (Disintegrator Pulse Laser):

*   Damage: 175 150
*   Range: 25 20
*   DPS: 175 150

*   2nd Weapon (Heavy Electron Bolter):

*   Damage: 12 14
*   Range: 25 20
*   Muzzle Velocity: 40 35
*   TurretYawSpeed: 90 120
*   DPS: 30 35

### ![](/assets/images/units/aeon/land/T3Sniper.png) Sprite Striker:

The aeon sniper is better able to shoot while moving and has a higher rate of fire in exchange for less speed and a higher cost.

*   Mass Cost: 640 720
*   Build Time: 3600 4000
*   Health: 450 500
*   Speed: 3 2.85
*   SizeX: 0.8 0.95
*   SizeY: 1.15 1.35
*   SizeZ: 0.6 0.8
*   Weapon

*   Firing Randomness while moving: 0.5 0.3
*   Rate of Fire: 0.142 0.15
*   MuzzleVelocity: 120 90
*   TurretYawSpeed: 90 110

### ![](/assets/images/units/sera/land/T3Sniper.png) Usha-Ah:

The sera sniper shoots more accurately while moving to avoid it wasting shots and it gets a cost increase and speed decrease.

*   Mass Cost: 640 800
*   Energy Cost: 8000 8800
*   Build Time: 3600 4300
*   Health: 500 700

*   SizeY: 1.2 1.55
*   SizeZ: 0.7 0.9

*   TurretYawSpeed: 90 70

*   Ranged Fire Mode:

*   Firing Randomness while moving: 0.5 0.2
*   Rate of Fire: 0.07 0.066
*   TurretYawSpeed: 90 50

### ![](/assets/images/units/aeon/land/T3MobileArty.png) T3 Mobile Artillery:

Build time is reduced for T3 mobile artillery.

*   Build Time: 4800 4300

### Experimentals

Experimentals have had very low build times which often made thoughtless mass sinks. With the T3 land nerf Experimentals will be a stronger force on the battlefield so build time is increased to compensate for this and to make XPs less of a cheese weapon thrown up in very short periods of time with little build power.
