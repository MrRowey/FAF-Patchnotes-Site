Patch 3709

# Patch 3709

#### Date: _December 16th 2019_

The aim of the patch is to make some necessary adjustments before the end of year tournament. In the past few months one of the main requests has been the removal or nerfing of "snipemode" which allowed units to specifically target the ACU. This turned out to be a mechanic that was too punishing and ultimately detrimental to gameplay.  
During the LotS qualifiers it also became clear that the mongoose and parashield combo was very strong and so we are addressing that here.  
We wish you good luck and much fun playing with the new patch!
