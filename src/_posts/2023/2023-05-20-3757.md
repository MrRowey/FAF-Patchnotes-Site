# Patch 3757

A balance patch has been released with a few important changes that have been planned for a while, but were delayed.  
We hope you enjoy this new patch

### \-- The Balance Team

## Land

### ![](/assets/images/units/aeon/land/T4GC.png) Galactic Colossus

Previously the claws would instantaneously destroy the unit upon arrival. This matched the old behavior, but with the bug fixes of the claws it was only slightly too strong.

- Claw Damage: 730 dps

## Structures

### ![](/assets/images/units/cybran/structure/T1AirStaging.png) Air Staging Facility

When they were moved from tech 2 to tech 1 their build time was not reduced accordingly.

- Build Time: 450 350

## ACUs

### ![](/assets/images/Enhancements/aeon/chrono.png) Chrono Dampener

- The chrono dampener received several buffs over the past year. With this patch we nerf it by changing how the Chrono Dampener behaves.
- The old behavior applies the same stun on all units over a large radius every 5.0 seconds. The stun duration was 3.5 seconds.
- The new behavior applies a diminishing stun based on the distance of the unit to the ACU over a large radius every 5.0 seconds. The stun is applied in slices of 0.4 seconds. There are 10 slices. Units that are on top of the ACU receive all slices, and are therefore stunned for 4.0 seconds. Units at the outer edge of the radius receive only a single slice and are therefore stunned for 0.4 seconds.
