## Land

### ![](/assets/images/units/cybran/land/T2MobileStealth.png) Deceiver

Unlike what the game makes you believe, intel works in a grid-like fashion. The cell size of stealth field intel is 4. Therefore, the previous increase of the radius from 20 to 23 has effectively no impact. The Deceiver now receives the buff it was intended to receive after increasing the vision range of a wide range of units.

### ![](/assets/images/units/cybran/land/T4MobileArty.png) Scathis

The Scathis now has the same selection priority as other experimental artillery.

## Navy

### ![](/assets/images/units/uef/naval/T2SheildBoat.png) Bulwark

The range of the dummy weapon indicates where the shield hits the water line. The dummy weapon prevents the Bulwark from sailing right into the enemy fleet when you issue an attack move order. It roughly remains at the same range as frigates.

### ![](/assets/images/units/aeon/naval/T3NukeSub.png)Nuke Subs

All non-experimental units with strategic missile launchers now have a 10-second reload time on their strategic missile launchers. The stationary strategic missile launchers were already affected by this reload time. It primarily applies to the strategic submarines and the Seraphim battleship.

### ![](/assets/images/units/aeon/naval/T3MissleShip.png) Missile Ship

The Aeon tech 3 missile ship is now cheaper to build. It fires more missiles that deal less damage but in a larger damage radius. The unit is now more equipped to overwhelm tactical missile defenses and deal damage in a wide area surrounding the target.

## Air

### ![](/assets/images/units/uef/air/T2FighterBomber.png) Bombers

Fix bombers with multiple unpropelled ordinances from being able to track the target while dropping the ordinance

This primarily impacts the Zeus, Scorcher, and the Janus. The behavior is only different when the target is trying to evade the bomber. The overall behavior should be more consistent now with that of other bombers.

## ACUs
