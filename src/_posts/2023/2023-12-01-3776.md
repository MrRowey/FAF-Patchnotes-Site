Patch 3776

# Patch 3776

#### Date: _December 1st 2023_

The focus of this patch is working on improving the implementation of the previous patch. Cybran regen is improved, Seraphim get a buff to their hps, as well as some smaller changes and fixes.  
We wish you good luck and much fun playing with the new patch!

### \-- Balance Team

---

## Air

### ![](/assets/images/units/uef/air/T2FighterBomber.png) Bombers

Janus gets a slight buff again to improve it slightly vs units.

- InitialDamage: 15 20
- TotalInitialDamage: 300 400
- DamageOverTime: 1500 1600

## Structures

### ![](/assets/images/units/cybran/structure/T3NavalHQ.png) T3 Naval Support Factories

T3 naval support facs were found to be too vulnerable considering the cost of the units being constructed within them so we have reduced their hp nerf.

- UEF HP: 13000 17000
- Seraphim HP: 10000 15000
- Aeon HP: 10000 13000
- Cybran HP: 8000 11000
- Cybran Regen HP: 15 30

### ![](/assets/images/units/uef/structure/T2NavalFacHQ.png)T2 UEF Naval Support Factory

This is a correction of the UEF T2 naval support factory which was missed in testing before the previous balance patch.

- HP: 6000 6500

### ![](/assets/images/units/aeon/structure/T1MassStorage.png) Mass Storage

Mass storage hp has been given some hp back, so that it is more in line with their cost.

- UEF HP: 760 1200
- Seraphim HP: 600 1100
- Aeon HP: 600 1000
- Cybran HP: 500 800
- Cybran HP Regeneration: 1 4

### Seraphim Structures

In the HP nerf patch Seraphim were given the same HP as Aeon. However we now decided to buff their HP so that they have more than Aeon, but still less than UEF. Seraphim have less unit choices and are not one of the strongest factions so some buffs are warranted and this also increases faction diversity.
