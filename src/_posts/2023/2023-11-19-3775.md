   Patch 3775 

Patch 3775
==========

#### Date: _November 19th 2023_

This patch aims at tackling the main issues of competitive team games: snipers, Ahwassa, ASAF spam, and T2 Arty. We're also re-balancing the walls to go hand in hand with the changes made to the engine.  
We wish you good luck and much fun playing with the new patch!

Land
----

### ![](/assets/images/units/cybran/land/T2MobileBomb.png) Fire Beetle

Beetles are currently underused, with this change they will be easier to quickly pump out.

*   Build Time: 700 550

### ![](/assets/images/units/uef/land/T2MobileML.png) T2 Mobile Missile Launcher

MMLs were nerfed quite heavily when TMD behavior was reworked. With these changes they will be cheaper and easier to build, while the range increase will make it easier to deal with T2 PDs without accidentally getting into their range.

*   EnergyCost: 1500 1350
*   MassCost: 200 180
*   BuildTime: 1000 800
*   MaxRange: 60 65

### T3 Mobile AA

Straight buff to T3 MAA. This allows players to get them out earlier. Cybran T3 MAA hp is relatively stronger to make up for the lack of mobile shields

### ![](/assets/images/units/aeon/land/T3MobileAA.png)Aeon

*   Mass Cost: 800 600
*   Energy Cost: 10000 7500

*   Energy Cost: 12800 9600
*   Build Time: 4800 3600
*   Health: 2100 1800

### ![](/assets/images/units/aeon/land/T3SheildDistruptor.png)T3 Shield Disruptor

The shield disruptor might not be used frequently by most players but it's an extremely strong and oppressive unit with very little counterplay at higher levels. By reducing its range and hp we hope to give players more counterplay possibilities.

*   Range: 75 65
*   Health: 1200 800

### T3 Direct Fire Heavy units

To make T3 stage more dynamic we're increasing the movement speed of all T3 direct fire heavy units.

### ![](/assets/images/units/cybran/land/T3Tank.png) Brick

Bricks also gets a small buff to its range which brings it in line with the Percy. With its current range the Brick wasn't able to properly kite enemy gun ACUs and it made the Brick extremely vulnerable to OC.

*   Main Gun Range: 32 34
*   Torpedo Range: 32 34
*   Anit-Torpedo Range: 32 34
*   MaxAcceleration: 2.3 2.4
*   MaxBrake: 2.3 2.4
*   MaxSpeed: 2.3 2.4
*   MaxSpeedReverse: 2.3 2.4

### ![](/assets/images/units/aeon/land/T3Tank.png) Harbinger

*   MaxAcceleration: 3.2 3.3
*   MaxBrake: 2.85 2.95
*   MaxSpeed: 2.85 2.95

### ![](/assets/images/units/sera/land/T3Tank.png) Othuum

*   MaxAcceleration: 3.5 3.55
*   MaxBrake: 2.75 2.85
*   MaxSpeed: 2.75 2.85

### ![](/assets/images/units/uef/land/T3Tank.png) Percival

*   MaxAcceleration: 2.1 2.2
*   MaxBrake: 2.1 2.2
*   MaxSpeed: 2.1 2.2
*   MaxSpeedReverse: 2.1 2.2

### T3 Sniper Bots

The reduction in speed and range will allow for more counterplay as the snipers will both need to be closer to the enemy and won't be able to retreat as quickly. This should allow other units to catch them if they are out of position. The cost changes shift the snipers to a later stage of T3 as it will be impossible to spam them out effectively without bigger investment into energy infrastructure. This should also make it much harder to quickly rush snipers and completely nullify an aggressive ACU.

### ![](/assets/images/units/aeon/land/T3Sniper.png)Aeon

*   MassCost: 880 700
*   EnergyCost: 14080 25000
*   MaxRadius: 70 60
*   MaxAcceleration: 2.6 2.4
*   MaxBrake: 2.6 2.4
*   MaxSpeed: 2.6 2.4

### ![](/assets/images/units/sera/land/T3Sniper.png)Sera

*   MassCost: 960 780
*   EnergyCost: 15360 27000
*   MainMaxRadius: 65 55
*   SecondMaxRadius: 75 65
*   MaxAcceleration: 2.4 2.2
*   MaxBrake: 2.4 2.2
*   MaxSpeed: 2.4 2.2

### ![](/assets/images/units/uef/land/T3MobileArty.png) T3 Mobile Artillery

Affects all non-Aeon T3 Mobile Arties. This halves the time it takes for T3 Arties to unpack, buffing them vs armies by making hit and run tactics more effective.

*   UEF Unpack: 0.5 1
*   Cybran Unpack: 0.4 0.8
*   Seraphim Unpack: 0.22 0.44

### ![](/assets/images/units/uef/land/T4Fatboy.png) Fatboy

This makes it easier to retreat with the Fatboy without it rotating which should make kiting easier and less frustrating. No longer will you need to issue tons of movement commands close together to make sure the Fatboy won't waste time turning around and die because of it.

*   BackUpDistance: 15 30

### ![](/assets/images/units/aeon/land/T4GC.png) Galactic Colossus

The Galactic Colossus has been the strongest experimental since its claws were fixed. It's particularly strong vs large T3 armies which are slower and can't effectively micro against the GC like they can against the Ythotha. The slower speed will make it harder for the GC to catch armies and retreat if it picks a losing battle.

*   MaxAcceleration: 2.5 2.4
*   MaxBrake: 2.5 2.4
*   MaxSpeed: 2.5 2.4

Navy
----

### T2 Cruisers

We have decided to partially revert the changes to cruisers as the changes unintentionally made them too vulnerable to T3 gunships. The higher hp also meant that sniping cruisers with non-air units became much harder which wasn't good for gameplay. To compensate for the addition of AoE the cruisers don't get their full range back. Since the Sera cruiser already had AoE its hp is not fully reverted and its secondary (non-flak) cannon is getting a major buff. This should allow the Sera cruiser to deal with targets that are further away properly.

### ![](/assets/images/units/aeon/naval/T2Cruiser.png)Aeon

*   AA AoE Radius: 0 1
*   Health: 3850 3250
*   AA Range: 60 70

### ![](/assets/images/units/uef/naval/T2Cruiser.png)UEF

*   AA AoE Radius: 0 1
*   Health: 3100 2500
*   AA Range: 60 70

### ![](/assets/images/units/cybran/naval/T2Cruiser.png)Cybran

*   AA AoE Radius: 0 1
*   Health: 3600 3000
*   AA Range: 60 70

### ![](/assets/images/units/sera/naval/T2Cruiser.png)Seraphim

*   Health: 3000 2700
*   2nd AA Range: 45 70
*   Flak AA Range: 55 60

### ![](/assets/images/units/uef/naval/T4AircraftCarrier.png)Atlantis

This makes it easier to retreat with the Atlantis without it rotating which should make kiting easier and less frustrating. No longer will you need to issue tons of movement commands close together to make sure the Atlantis won't waste time turning around and die because of it.

*   BackUpDistance: 15 30

Air
---

### ![](/assets/images/units/sera/air/T4Bomber.png)Ahwassa

Ahwassa's damage is now split in two phases. The initial impact of the bomb deals 10% of the damage, the rest of the damage is dealt after 2.5 seconds of the bomb's explosion "gathering" energy and then exploding creating a shockwave. The damage from this explosion is split into 3 waves each dealing 30% of the damage every 1 tick (0.1 seconds). This change is meant as a nerf of Ahwassa vs mobile units as the experimental bomber was extremely oppressive vs T3 mobile armies and offered little counterplay. With these changes the armies have a small window to get out of the explosion's radius and dodge the bomb.

### ![](/assets/images/units/cybran/air/T2Transport.png)T2 Transports

This nerf is aimed primarily at arty drops which are very hard to counter. The reduced speed will allow interceptors to catch up to the transport even if they are not in the perfect position to defend.

*   Movement Speed: 14.3 13.5

### ![](/assets/images/units/uef/air/T2FighterBomber.png) Janus

Janus are currently a lot more efficient BT and E wise compared to interceptors which makes it very difficult to spam enough inties to keep up with Janus production. These changes allow for more counterplay vs Janus and makes them a less of an all-in unit. The reduced mass cost should make the Janus more viable in lower numbers and not require an all-in scenario

*   Mass Cost: 420 360
*   Energy Cost: 8400 12600
*   Build Time: 2400 2800

### Stinger & Vulthoo

### ![](/assets/images/units/uef/air/T2Gunship.png)Stinger

Supports the intended identity of the Stinger, which is to be a fast, cheap raider and a hybrid transport.

*   Mass Cost: 240 192
*   Energy Cost: 4800 3840
*   Build Time: 1600 1280
*   Health: 880 700
*   DPS: 66.6 53
*   MovementSpeed: 12 13.5

### ![](/assets/images/units/sera/air/T2Gunship.png)Vulthoo

Reinforces a more unique identity for the Vulthoo as a tech 2.5 gunship. Makes up for Sera lack of t3 gunship.

*   MaxAirspeed: 12 11
*   Health: 1080 1800
*   UniformScale: 0.06 0.066
*   Energy Cost: 6000 10000
*   Mass Cost: 300 500
*   Build Time: 2000 3300
*   Damage(DPS): 16(80) 19.2(100)

### Torpedo Bombers

Increases the number of torpedo's dropped while reducing the damage of individual torpedo's. The damage output of a salvo remains unchanged. This change reduces the impact of anti torpedo weaponry against torpedo bombers.

### ![](/assets/images/units/aeon/air/T2TorpedoBomber.png)Aeon

*   Damage: 250 150
*   MuzzleSalvoDelay: 0.6 0.2
*   MuzzleSalvoSize: 3 5

*   Damage: 250 150
*   MuzzleSalvoDelay: 0.6 0.2
*   MuzzleSalvoSize: 3 5

### ![](/assets/images/units/cybran/air/T2TorpedoBomber.png)Cybran

*   Damage: 50 30
*   MuzzleSalvoDelay: 0.6 0.2
*   MuzzleSalvoSize: 3 5

### ![](/assets/images/units/sera/air/T2TorpedoBomber.png)Seraphim

*   Damage: 250 150
*   MuzzleSalvoDelay: 0.6 0.1
*   MuzzleSalvoSize: 3 5

### ![](/assets/images/units/aeon/air/T2Mercy.png) Mercy

Increases the damage of the mercy and introduces a new, alternative effect. The new effect is better at communicating the radius that receives damage over time.

*   Damage: 30 50 damage per tick
*   Total Damage: 600 1000

### T3 Air Superiority Fighters

Reduce the size of ASF blobs in the late game. Reduce ASF effectiveness vs interceptors (due to larger overkill). Bring ASF mass cost more in line with other T3 units.

### ![](/assets/images/units/aeon/air/T3ASF.png)Aeon

*   Mass Cost: 350 450
*   Energy Cost: 40000 51200
*   Build Time: 3000 3840
*   Damage: 405 505

*   Damage: 405 505
*   Health: 1775 2275

Structures
----------

### ![](/assets/images/units/uef/structure/T1Wall.png)Walls

After patching the game's engines walls are now properly blocking projectiles. Because of this their hp is being reduced and their cost increased. To reduce the impact of these changes on walls that are built with impeding enemy movement in mind the Build Time of walls is reduced.

Note: These changes have been merged alongside the development patch that brought the engine fix so they've been apart of FAF for around a month now.

Note: X is the current hp of each faction's wall.

*   Health: X 500
*   Energy Cost: 10 20
*   Mass Cost: 2 3
*   Build Time: 20 15

### ![](/assets/images/units/cybran/structure/T1LandFac.png)Land Factories

*   T2 Build Time: 1600 1200
*   T3 Build Time: 4000 3200

### ![](/assets/images/units/aeon/structure/T1AirFactory.png)Air Factories

Brings the T2 and T3 air factory build time in line with their land counterparts.

HQs

*   T3 Build Time: 12100 12000

Support

*   T2 Build Time: 1300 1200
*   T3 Build Time: 4000 3200

### ![](/assets/images/units/uef/structure/T2NavalFacHQ.png)Naval Factories

Standardizes build time across all factories to make more sense and be more balanced. No longer will the T2 -> T3 Support factory upgrade be ~4 times faster than the T1 -> T2 upgrade.

HQs

*   T2 Build Time: 3600 3200
*   T3 Build Time: 11250 21600

Support

*   T2 Build Time: 3000 2000
*   T3 Build Time: 3500 10800

### T2 Artillery

### ![](/assets/images/units/sera/structure/T2StaticArty.png)Seraphim

*   FiringRandomness: 1.75 2
*   MaxRadius: 128 115

### ![](/assets/images/units/aeon/structure/T3PowerGen.png) Tech 3 Power Generators Adjacency

This change effects only buildings the size of a factory and the ones that have active consumption (as opposed to maintenance, for example radar is unaffected).

T3 pgen adjacency is extremely efficient and scaling your air grid by adding extra T3 power generators and support air factories is the only viable choice. With this change, we hope to force players to make a conscious decision if they wish to quickly scale their production by increasing the assistance on their HQ or reap the long-term benefits of expanding their air grid. This change also makes spamming high amounts of ASFs harder.

*   Active Energy Adjacency Buff: \-18.75% \-15.62%

ACUs
----

### ![](/assets/images/Enhancements/uef/bubblesheild.png)UEF ACU Bubble Shield Upgrade

Currently, the bubble shield isn't used as it's too expensive and arrives too late to be useful. We hope that by shifting the upgrade to the mid-game stage it will allow UEF players to better take advantage of the upgrade with a Mongoose push or by protecting their first few T3 units from Overcharge.

*   Energy Cost: 112500 70000
*   Mass Cost: 2300 2000
*   Build Time: 2100 1700
*   Shield Health: 9000 7000
*   Shield Recharge Time: 90 60
*   Shield Regen Rate: 60 67
