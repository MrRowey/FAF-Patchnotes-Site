   Patch 3761 

Patch 3761
==========

#### Date: _July 15th 2023_

The main objective of this patch is to enhance the viability of a diverse range of strategies by boosting raiding capabilities, balancing overpowered units, and introducing novel ways to utilize existing units.

### \-- The Balance Team

* * *

Land
----

### ![](/assets/images/units/aeon/land/T1Scout.png) Spirit

Brings the Spirit's speed in line with the other t1 scouts. This plays a small role in reducing the effectiveness of tree breaking as well.

*   Max Speed: 5 4.6
*   Max Acceleration: 5 4.6

### Mongoose and Hoplite

The following changes make these units better at staying on target while moving.

![](/assets/images/units/uef/land/T2RangeBot.png)**Mongoose**

*   Turn Rate: 90 80
*   Rack Salvo Charge Time: 2 1
*   Rack Salvo Reload Time: 1 2
*   Turret Yaw Speed: 80 90

![](/assets/images/units/cybran/land/T2RangeBot.png)**Hoplite**

*   Turn Rate: 90 80
*   Muzzle Velocity: 15 20
*   Turret Yaw Speed: 60 130

### ![](/assets/images/units/cybran/land/T2MobileStealth.png) Deceiver

This buff is to counter the vision change to ensure that the Deceiver is not obsolete.

*   Stealth Range: 20 23

### Tech 2 Amphibious Tanks

This change is to go along with the vision change to ensure their base vision range is at the same range as their weapon before the +15% is added.

Also Wagner Torpedoes get a buff.

![](/assets/images/units/uef/land/T2HoverTank.png)**Riptide**

*   Vision Radius: 15 18

![](/assets/images/units/cybran/land/T2HoverTank.png)**Wagner**

*   Vision Radius: 15 22
*   Water Vision Radius: 20 22
*   Torpedo Damage: 15 30

![](/assets/images/units/sera/land/T2HoverTank.png)**Yenzyne**

*   Vision Radius: 15 20

![](/assets/images/units/aeon/land/T2HoverTank.png)**Blaze**

*   Vision Radius: 15 24

  

### Tech 3 Amphibious Tanks

Based on a Pull Request by Basilisk3 we have decided to buff the torpedoes and anti-torpedoes of T3 amphibious units. This will make them a bit more viable when they're underwater

![](/assets/images/units/cybran/land/T3Tank.png)**Brick**

*   Damage: 8 15
*   Anti Torp Flare RoF: 0.065 0.05

![](/assets/images/units/sera/land/T3Tank.png)**Othuum**

*   Damage: 30 60

### ![](/assets/images/units/uef/land/T3MobileML.png) Mobile Missile Launchers and Spearhead

MML and Spearhead missiles are much faster now. This should help them against recent TMD buffs and help hit mobile units

*   increased Missile Speed by 1.75x

### Land Experimentals

### ![](/assets/images/units/cybran/land/T4MobileArty.png) Scathis

This unit was far more inaccurate than desired or indicated by the reticle. Some shots still go outside the reticle but with this change this is greatly reduced. Increasing its accuracy any further buffed its performance against shielded bases too much.

*   Fixed Spread Radius: 80 70

### ![](/assets/images/units/aeon/land/T4GC.png) Galactic Colossus

Removal of Omni as this only served as a hard counter to Cybran Cloak.

*   Omni removed

Navy
----

### Frigates

The range decrease and cost increase to Cybran frigates combined to too much of a nerf. The exact opposite is true for Aeon frigates, so we are revoking the cost change for both.

![](/assets/images/units/aeon/naval/T1Frigate.png)**Aeon**

*   Energy Cost: 2800 2900
*   Mass Cost: 280 290
*   Build Time: 1400 1450

![](/assets/images/units/cybran/naval/T1Frigate.png)**Cybran**

*   Energy Cost: 2600 2500
*   Mass Cost: 260 250
*   Build Time: 1300 1250

### Tech 1 Subs

All T1 subs are getting a survivability increase which allows subs to take 2 hits from torp bombers. This does not apply to Sera, but they have anti torp which will accomplish the same result.

![](/assets/images/units/aeon/naval/T1Sub.png)**Aeon**

*   HP: 550 775

![](/assets/images/units/uef/naval/T1Sub.png)**UEF**

*   HP: 600 800

![](/assets/images/units/cybran/naval/T1Sub.png)**Cybran**

*   HP: 525 775

![](/assets/images/units/sera/naval/T1Sub.png)**Seraphim**

*   HP: 400 550

### ![](/assets/images/units/aeon/naval/T1AABoat.png) Shard

The Shard is rarely used due to low damage. This change is to make it more viable.

*   Build Time: 800 600
*   Damage: 6 7.5

### ![](/assets/images/units/cybran/naval/T2Destoryer.png) Cybran Destroyer

We increased the range for the Salem before but found it to still be lacking considering the nerf to their frigates. This should help bring their T2 navy in line with the other factions.

*   Max Range: 80 85

### Cruisers

All cruisers are getting increased HP and decreased range. This change will make sending torpedoes directly into cruisers much less efficient, but at the same time reduce cruiser AA coverage. Instead picking off ships out of range will be favored. Non-Aeon TMD is buffed to deal with a larger number of missiles.

![](/assets/images/units/aeon/naval/T2Cruiser.png)**Aeon**

*   HP: 3250 3850
*   AA Range: 75 60

![](/assets/images/units/uef/naval/T2Cruiser.png)**UEF**

*   HP: 2500 3100
*   AA Range: 75 60
*   TMD:

*   Range: 50 60
*   Rate of Fire (RoF): 0.5 0.25

![](/assets/images/units/cybran/naval/T2Cruiser.png)**Cybran**

*   HP: 3000 3600
*   AA Range: 75 60
*   TMD:

*   Range: 50 60
*   Rate of Fire (RoF): 0.5 0.25

![](/assets/images/units/sera/naval/T2Cruiser.png)**Seraphim**

*   HP: 2400 3000
*   AA Range: 65 55
*   TMD:

*   Range: 50 60
*   Rate of Fire (RoF): 0.5 0.25

### ![](/assets/images/units/uef/naval/T2TorpBoat.png) Cooper

The Coopers will be getting a tight formation so they cover each other better with their torp defense. Additionally, they get multiple stat changes to get an overall buff.

*   Energy Cost: 7200 6480
*   Mass Cost: 900 810
*   Build Time: 3600 3240
*   Footprint: Made Cooper Fit tighter and better in formation
*   Max Range: 50 55
*   Water Vision: 45 55

### Aircraft Carriers

The increased Vision and Water Vision Radii will allow carriers to detect subs and provide intel to their fleets. The Aeon and Seraphim carriers get TMD to let then deal with missiles. The existing Cybran carrier TMD gets the same buff as on their cruiser

![](/assets/images/units/cybran/naval/T3AircraftCarrier.png)**Cybran**

*   Water Vision Radius: 36 100
*   Vision Radius: 85 100
*   TMD:

*   Range: 50 60
*   Rate of Fire (RoF): 0.5 0.25

![](/assets/images/units/aeon/naval/T3AircraftCarrier.png)**Aeon**

*   Water Vision Radius: 36 100
*   Vision Radius: 85 100
*   Added TMD

![](/assets/images/units/sera/naval/T3AircraftCarrier.png)**Seraphim**

*   Water Vision Radius: 36 100
*   Vision Radius: 85 100
*   Added TMD

### Battleships and Battle-cruiser

The TMD range of Battleships and the Battle-cruiser has been nerfed to make them less self-sufficient and push them to use Cruisers and Aircraft Carriers for adequate TMD coverage.

![](/assets/images/units/uef/naval/T3Battleship.png)**Battleships**

*   TMD Range: 50 40
*   Sera Speed: 3 3.2
*   Cybran Speed: 3 3.2

![](/assets/images/units/uef/naval/T3BattleCruiser.png)**Battle-cruiser**

*   TMD Range: 50 40

### Naval Experimentals

### ![](/assets/images/units/uef/naval/T4AircraftCarrier.png) Atlantis

Atlantis has long been overdue for a buff. The speed increase improves its micro ability while the size decrease makes ground firing less effective.

*   Uniform Scale: 0.1 0.09
*   Max Speed: 2.8 3.3
*   SelectionSizeX: 1.8 1.62
*   SelectionSizeZ: 12.8 11.52
*   SizeX: 2.8 2.52
*   SizeY: 2.3 2.07
*   SizeZ: 20 18

### ![](/assets/images/units/aeon/naval/T4Battleship.png) Tempest

This is to improve the handling of the Tempest.

*   Back Up Distance: 0 45
*   Max Speed Reverse: 0 2.5
*   Rotate On Spot: true false
*   Turn Rate: 30 35

Air
---

### ![](/assets/images/units/other/air.png) Air Elevations

Generally, lower flying targets are easier to hit with ground-to-air weapons. However, if they are brought too low, they can fire at shields in the case of interceptors or inside shields in the case of bombers. Therefore T2 planes are brought to an elevation just above T2 shields and T3 planes are brought to an elevation just above T3 shields.

*   T1 Scout: 20 16
*   T1 Interceptor: 18 14
*   T1 Bomber: 18 14
*   T2 Combat Fighter: 20 18
*   T3 Scout: 25 22
*   T3 Air Superiority: 20 18
*   T3 Strategic Bomber: 14 18
*   T3 Torpedo Bomber: 25 18
*   T4 CZAR: 25 20

### Transports

Adjust the movement of air transports to increase consistency and responsiveness. This means that placing unload orders on the fly will not cause a huge delay in unloading. It also makes transports quite easy to micro, so we are giving interceptors similar changes to help them against the new transports.

### ![](/assets/images/units/sera/air/T1Transport.png)Tech 1 Transports

*   Elevation: 8
*   AutoLandTime: 1 2
*   BankFactor: 0.1 0.2
*   BankForward: False True
*   KMove: 0.95 2
*   KTurn: 1 2
*   KTurnDamping: 4 2
*   LiftFactor: 8 2
*   TransportHoverHeight: 6 4
*   CollisionOffsetY: 0 \-0.25

### ![](/assets/images/units/cybran/air/T2Transport.png)Tech 2 Transports

*   Elevation: 9
*   AutoLandTime: 1 2
*   BankFactor: 0.1 0.2
*   BankForward: False True
*   KMove: 0.95 2
*   KTurn: 1 2
*   KTurnDamping: 4 2
*   LiftFactor: 8 2
*   TransportHoverHeight: 6 4
*   CollisionOffsetY: 0.1 \-0.25

### ![](/assets/images/units/uef/air/T3Transportl.png)Tech 3 Transports

*   T3 Elevation: 10
*   AutoLandTime: 1 2
*   BankFactor: 0.1 0.2
*   BankForward: False True
*   KLift: 1 2
*   KLiftDamping: 1.25 2
*   KMove: 0.8 2
*   KTurn: 1 2
*   KTurnDamping: 4 2
*   LiftFactor: 7 4
*   CollisionOffsetY: \-0.1 \-0.25

### Interceptors and SwiftWind

This change helps balance out the transport changes. This also makes Interceptors feel more responsive and better to micro.

### ![](/assets/images/units/aeon/air/T1Interceptor.png) Tech 1 Interceptors

*   AutoLandTime: 1 2
*   BankFactor: 2 3
*   BreakOffDistance: 5 10
*   CombatTurnSpeed: 1.5 1.7
*   KLift: 3 2
*   KLiftDamping: 2.5 2.0
*   KMove: 1 1.5
*   LiftFactor: 7 5
*   StartTurnDistance: 5 10
*   TurnSpeed: 1.5 1.7

### ![](/assets/images/units/aeon/air/T2CombatFighter.png) Swift Wind

*   BankFactor: 2 3
*   CombatTurnSpeed: 1.5 1.8
*   KLift: 3 2
*   KLiftDamping: 2.5 2.0
*   KMove: 1 1.5
*   LiftFactor: 7 5
*   StartTurnDistance: 5 10
*   TurnSpeed: 1.5 1.8

### ![](/assets/images/units/uef/air/T1ACUDrone.png)ACU and SCU Drones

Updated the ACU and SCU Drone HP to 50, the same as Kennel drones

*   Health: 6 50

### ![](/assets/images/units/uef/air/T2KennelDrone.png) Drones

Gives all drones the ability to reclaim on a patrol move. This Dose Not Include ACU or SCU Drones

### ![](/assets/images/units/aeon/air/T2Mercy.png)Mercy

Based on [Deribus's suggestion](https://forum.faforever.com/topic/1834/ideas-for-mercy-changes) from a while ago, this changes the Mercy's role from a sniping unit to a damage over time AOE unit.

We have tweaked the setting a bit more and added a reticule so you're able to see the area of effect when Mercy is fired

*   Max Speed: 10 13
*   Min Speed: 10 3
*   Turning Speed: 1.5 1
*   Health: 10 90
*   VisionRadius: 15 10
*   Elevation: 18 12
*   Damage: 2400 79
*   DamageRadius: 3 7.5
*   Damage Ticks: 0 20
*   Damage Time: 0 10
*   Fuel Duration: 110 400
*   Added Vision Projectile on impact

### Torpedo Bombers

All of the Tech 2 Torpedo Bombers now have the same number of projectiles. This is important as they are vulnerable to anti-torpedoes now.

### ![](/assets/images/units/uef/air/T2TorpedoBomber.png)UEF

*   Projectile Count: 2 3

### ![](/assets/images/units/cybran/air/T2TorpedoBomber.png)Cybran

*   Projectile Count: 2 3

### ![](/assets/images/units/cybran/air/T3Strat.png) Strategic Bombers

A slight decrease in cost and build time but a large increase in reload time. This should prevent early bombers from 1-passing so many targets in quick succession.

*   Mass Cost: 2100 1750
*   Energy Cost: 144k 180k
*   Build Time: 9.6k 12k
*   Rate of Fire: 5s 8s

Structures
----------

### Torpedo Defenses

Decreases the volatility of T1 navy and makes getting locked out of the water at T1 harder.

### Tech 1 Torpedo Defense

**![](/assets/images/units/uef/structure/T1TorpedoDef.png)UEF**

*   Damage: 150 180

**![](/assets/images/units/aeon/structure/T1TorpDefence.png)Aeon**

**![](/assets/images/units/sera/structure/T1TorpedoDef.png)Seraphim**

*   Damage: 100 120

### Tech 2 Torpedo Defense

**![](/assets/images/units/uef/structure/T2TorpedoDef.png)UEF**

*   Damage: 150 180

**![](/assets/images/units/aeon/structure/T2TorpDefence.png)Aeon**

*   Damage: 150 180

**![](/assets/images/units/cybran/structure/T2TorpedoDef.png)Cybran**

*   Damage: 50 60

**![](/assets/images/units/sera/structure/T2TorpedoDef.png)Seraphim**

*   Damage: 201 242

### ![](/assets/images/units/cybran/structure/T3TorpedoDef.png) HARMS

We are decreasing the harm caused by HARMS by removing the stealth and reducing both their HP and Range.

*   Removed Personal Stealth
*   HP: 11000 9000
*   Build Time: 4097 4100
*   Max Radius: 80 70

### Sonar

The current range of T1/T2 sonar is lacking compared to T1/T2 radar considering the speed difference between land and navy units. T1 and T2 sonar will be getting a range buff to make them more useful while giving them more expensive to build and run to balance them out.

The Cybran Tech 3 Sonar has also gotten a nerf to its stealth field and received a small E drain cost reduction.

### Tech 1 Sonar

![](/assets/images/units/aeon/structure/T1sonar.png)**Aeon**

Tech 2 Sonar
------------

![](/assets/images/units/aeon/structure/T2Sonar.png)**Aeon**

*   Health: 1000 800

### Tech 3 Sonar

![](/assets/images/units/cybran/structure/T3Sonar.png)**Cybran**

*   HP: 850 1200
*   Maintenance Cost: 700 600
*   Radar Stealth Field Radius: 70 40
*   Sonar Stealth Field Radius: 70 40

### ![](/assets/images/units/aeon/structure/T3Sam.png) SAMS

SAMs have always had a disproportionate amount of hp for their cost, making them nearly invulnerable to raids. If you built a SAM it would stay there until you got pushed off the area entirely. This change will allow them to be raided, including by air-to-ground units and TML.

*   HP: 7000 5000

### Economy Structures

In the early game, the primary focus is on raiding expanding engineers. One engineer's death may have potentially devastating consequences. On the other hand, after the expansion phase is over it can be very difficult to find value with light raids. We'd like to encourage more interaction between players by increasing the damage potential of small raids after the expansion phase.

Reducing Mex HP across the board should encourage raiding across most of the game. In particular, the T1 Mex HP reduction allows for T1 bombers to destroy them in just two passes, which should help them find utility outside of their regular engineer-slaying duties.

### Mass Extractors

![](/assets/images/units/aeon/structure/T1MassExtractor.png)**Tech 1**

*   Cybran: 500 360
*   UEF: 760 400
*   Aeon: 600 370
*   Sera: 650 380

![](/assets/images/units/sera/structure/T2MassExtractor.png)**Tech 2**

*   UEF: 2500 2000
*   Sera: 2000 1950

![](/assets/images/units/uef/structure/T3MassExtractor.png)**Tech 3**

T3 Mex hp is brought closer together and Cybran T3 Mex no longer die to a single TML

*   Cybran: 6000 6250
*   UEF: 9000 7000
*   Aeon: 6200 6500
*   Sera: 7000 6750

* * *

### Power Generators

![](/assets/images/units/sera/structure/T1PowerGen.png)**Seraphim Tech 1 Power Generator**

Make it so that the Seraphim tech 1 Power generator has the same consistency as all the others.

*   Removed Death Animation

### ![](/assets/images/units/aeon/structure/T1MassStorage.png) Mass Storage

*   Cybran: 800 600
*   UEF: 1200 800
*   Aeon: 1000 650
*   Sera: 1100 700

* * *

### ![](/assets/images/units/uef/structure/T1EnergyStorage.png) Energy Storage

*   Capacity: 5000 10000
*   Storage Adjacency: Increased by x2

ACU
---

### Aeon ACU

The Aeon gun range upgrade is quite powerful with the current cost. We have split it to allow it to still be strong later but not oppressive in the game's t1/early t2 phase. This along with the OC nerf should make the Aeon gun com far less oppressive while still being viable.

### ![](/assets/images/Enhancements/aeon/range.png) Range

*   Energy Cost: 15000 6000
*   Mass Cost: 500 300
*   Build Time: 500 350
*   New Range: 35 30

### ![](/assets/images/Enhancements/aeon/advanced range.png)Advanced Range

*   Requires First Range upgrade
*   Energy Cost: 31000
*   Mass Cost: 900
*   Build Time: 1100
*   New Range: 35

### ![](/assets/images/Enhancements/aeon/chrono.png) Chrono Dampener

The Chrono Dampener upgrade now adapts to your ACU gun range so depending on the ACU current range chrono will increase along with it.

### UEF ACU

### ![](/assets/images/Enhancements/uef/bubbleshield.png) Bubble Shield

This splits the shield upgrades so you decide whether to have the personal shield or the bubble shield

**Changes**

*   Split from Personal Shield
*   Mass Cost: 3600 2300
*   Energy Cost: 450000 112500
*   Build Time: 3400 2100
*   Maintenance Cost: 500 250
*   Shield HP: 36000 9000
*   Shield Regen Rate: 42 60
*   Shield Recharge Time: 175 90
*   Shield Size: 16 20

### Cybran ACU

Cybran is especially reliant on Stealth for their combat ACU, so it gets some buffs as well as a much needed self-repair upgrade to lessen the impact of vision changes.

Maser gets a nerf to lessen the potential of maser + self-repair.

*   Base Regen: 15 18

### ![](/assets/images/Enhancements/cybran/nano.png) Self-Repair

*   Upgrade Path: Stealth Self-Repair Cloak
*   Mass Cost: 1500
*   Energy Cost: 45000
*   Build Time: 1500
*   Regen: 60
*   HP: 1500

### ![](/assets/images/Enhancements/cybran/cloack.png) Cloak

*   HP: 15000 12000

### ![](/assets/images/Enhancements/cybran/torp.png) Torp

*   Damage: 250 500
*   Projectile Count: 4 2

### ![](/assets/images/Enhancements/cybran/lazer.png) Laser

*   DPS: 4000 3000

### Seraphim ACU
