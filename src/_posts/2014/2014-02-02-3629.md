### Tech 1 land

#### ![](/assets/images/units/aeon/land/T1Tank.png)Aurora

It’s a very small randomness and only when the Auroras move. They will still hit most of the time but this gives a chance for other tanks to survive longer. This value can be adjusted to make Auroras not as efficient when retreating, but good when they are still.

*   Speed = 3.1 2.9
*   FiringRandomnessWhileMoving = 0 0.6

#### ![](/assets/images/units/cybran/land/T1MobileArty.png)Medusa

*   T2StunDuration = 3 2
*   ReloadTime = 5 6
*   Damage = 195 230
*   DPS = 39 38.33

#### ![](/assets/images/units/uef/land/T1MobileArty.png)Lobo

*   Damage = 480 400
*   ReloadTime = 10 8.33

#### ![](/assets/images/units/aeon/land/T1MobileAA.png)All T1 Mobile AA

*   VisionRadius = 18 20

### Tech 2 Land

#### ![](/assets/images/units/uef/land/T2RangeBot.png)Mongoose

The unit tracks and targets enemy units better.

*   TurnSpeed = 150 90
*   FiringTolerance = 0.1 1
*   Grenade Weapon:
    *   Damage = 65 50
    *   RateOfFire = 0.1 0.15
    *   DPS = 26 30
    *   FiringRandomness = 2 2.5
    *   PitchRange = 0 55

#### ![](/assets/images/units/sera/land/T2Tank.png)Ilshavoh

*   VetThreshold = 9 10

### Tech 3 Land

#### ![](/assets/images/units/aeon/land/T3Sniper.png)Aeon Sniper

*   Damage = 1350 950
*   Reload = 10 7
*   FiringRandomnessWhileMoving = 0.8 0.75
*   FiringTolerance = 2 0

#### ![](/assets/images/units/sera/land/T3Sniper.png)Seraphim Sniper

*   Damage = 775 580
*   Reload = 6.7 5
*   FiringRandomnessWhileMoving = 0.8 0.75
*   FiringTolerance = 2 0
*   Sniper Mode:
    *   Damage = 2800 2000
    *   Reload = 20 14.5
    *   FiringRandomnessWhileMoving = 0.8 0.6

Air

### Tech 1 Air

#### ![](/assets/images/units/uef/air/T1Bommber.png)UEF T1 Bomber

*   4 Bombs with 3 AOE (Instead of 5 with 2.5 AOE)
*   Bombs are more spread out, and each deals 47.5 Damage instantly + 10\*4 = 40 damages over 1.5 seconds = 350 total (It will never deal 350 Damage except on Factories. The maximum amount on Units
and small Structures is 267.5)*   TurnSpeed = 0.8 (From 0.7)
*   BreakOffDistance = 26 (From 18)

#### ![](/assets/images/units/cybran/air/T1Gunship.png)Cybran Jester

*   Range = 20 (From 16). This fixes the fact that they stop shooting when attacking moving targets or are on Attack-Move orders)
*   Veterancy nerf: Threshold = 5 (From 3)

### Tech 2 Air

#### ![](/assets/images/units/uef/air/T2FighterBomber.png)Janus

*   Ground weapon Range = 60 (From 45)
*   LiftFactor = 10 (From 7) to increase the chance of dropping
*   Deals half its Damage instantly and the rest over time (Instead of all Damage being dealt over time)

#### ![](/assets/images/units/sera/air/T2FighterBomber.png)Notha

*   Ground weapon Range = 60 (From 45).
*   LiftFactor = 10 (From 7) to increase the chance of dropping.

#### ![](/assets/images/units/cybran/air/T2FighterBomber.png)Corsair

*   Anti-Ground weapon Range = 40 (From 45) so that it doesn’t completely out-range Mobile Flack (No longer able to kill them without suffering any damage)

### Tech 3 Air

#### Heavy Gunships

*   Speed + 2
*   Cost and DPS cut by roughly 25%

#### ![](/assets/images/units/cybran/air/T3Gunship.png)Wailer

*   MaxAirSpeed = 10 (From 8)
*   Mass = 1260
*   BuildTime = 6400
*   Energy = 42000 (From 52500)
*   Damage = 140 (From 150)
*   RateOfFire = 1.6 (From 2). DPS = 224 (From 300)

#### ![](/assets/images/units/uef/air/T3Gunship.png)Broadsword

*   MaxAirSpeed = 10 (From 8)
*   Mass = 1260
*   BuildTime = 6000
*   Energy = 42000 (From 52500)
*   Damage = 90 (From 100)
*   RateOfFire = 2.5 (From 3). DPS = 225 (From 300)

#### ![](/assets/images/units/aeon/air/T3AAGunship.png)Restorer

### Tech 4 Air

#### ![](/assets/images/units/cybran/air/T4Gunship.png)Soul Ripper

*   Veterancy adjusted to 80/160/240/320/400 (From 60/120/180/240/300)

Naval
-----

### Tech 1 Navy

*   Frigate Veterancy threshold = 6 XP (From 8)

#### ![](/assets/images/units/cybran/naval/T1Frigate.png)Cybran Frigate

*   Damage = 45 (From 40)
*   RateOfFire = 1.36 (From 1.53)
*   DPS is unchanged

#### ![](/assets/images/units/uef/naval/T1Frigate.png)UEF Frigate

*   Damage = 85 (From 140)
*   RateOfFire = 0.588 (From 0.35)

### Tech 2 Navy

#### ![](/assets/images/units/sera/naval/T2Destroyer.png)Destroyer

*   Front Gun DPS = 125 (From 105). Rear Gun DPS = 65 (From 95)
*   TurretYawRange = 120 (From 140)
*   TurretYawSpeed = 60 (From 90)
*   Attack Angle = 70 (From 60)
*   It will be slightly less efficient when micromanaged.

### Tech 3 Navy

#### ![](/assets/images/units/aeon/naval/T3NukeSub.png)Strategic Missile Submarines

*   Tactical Missile Range = 256 (From 175). This is the same as a TML. This will expand the sniping potential of these units.
*   Mass = 9000 (From 10000). This is the same as the Seraphim Battleship
*   Nuke inner ring Damage = 22000 (From 25000)
*   Nuke outer ring Damage = 3000 (From 500). This means units which escape the inner ring take some real Damage (500 is nothing for Naval units)

#### ![](/assets/images/units/sera/naval/T3SubHunter.png) T3 Submarine

*   SizeY = 0.9 (From 0.8). This is a slightly higher hitbox to ensure Riptides and other surface weapons can hit them normally while they are surfaced.
*   Range = 65 (From 70)
*   AA DPS = 200 (From 240)
*   Health = 4000 (From 4500)

#### ![](/assets/images/units/cybran/naval/T3AircraftCarrier.png)Aircraft Carrier

*   Cybran and Seraphim Aircraft Carriers can now build Gunships and regular Bombers.

### Tech 4 Navy

*   2 Atlantis and their equivalent mass cost in T3 Seraphim subs still win convincingly, but the Tempest can now put up a fight even when submerged.

#### ![](/assets/images/units/aeon/naval/T4Battleship.png)Tempest

*   Torpedoes are now Depth charges, which totally ignore all forms of Torpedo Defense.
*   Damage = 350 (From 235)
*   RateOfFire = 0.2 (From 0.25)
*   DPS = 420 (From 352)

ACUs
----

### ![](/assets/images/Enhancements/sera/regenfield.png)Seraphim Restoration Field

----

### ![](/assets/images/Enhancements/aeon/t2.png)All SCU T2
