Patch 3688

# Patch 3688

#### Date: _September 24th 2017_

This balance patch will be a small one. The main feature of this patch is the move to a mass-based veterancy system.  
We have also scrapped changes to the shield spillover and overcharge for now since we want to do them either after or with the next patch.  
We hope you can appreciate the changes we made with this patch and welcome constructive feedback via the forum.

We wish you good luck and much fun playing with the new patch!

## Land

### ![](/assets/images/units/sera/land/T1MobileArty.png) Seraphim T1 Mobile Artillery

The seraphim t1 arty is currently a very strong tool vs navy. The speed on water nerf - which has been done to other hover units before already - will make the life of the average aeon navy player a bit easier.

- WaterSpeedMultiplier : 1 0.9

### ![](/assets/images/units/uef/land/T2MobileML.png) Flapjack

Overall we are pretty happy with the recent MML buffs but the Flapjack buff was a bit over the top.

- Volley size: 3 2

## Air

### ![](/assets/images/units/cybran/air/T3Gunship.png)Gunships

We have found that the seraphim gunship is fairly unimpressive especially considering Seraphim do not get a T3 gunship. We've improved it across the board and increased the price.  
The ability changes for the t3 gunships are

#### Seraphim T2 Gunship

- Health: 864 1080
- Power Build Cost: 4800 6000
- Mass Build Cost: 240 300
- Build Time: 1600 2000
- Damage: 12 16

We've moved around the abilities of the UEF and Cybran T3 gunships to better fit the faction designs.

- Cybran T3 Gunships have a personal stealth ability instead of radar jamming.
- UEF T3 Gunships have radar jamming.

## Navy

### ![](/assets/images/units/sera/naval/T1Sub.png) Seraphim T1 Submarine

We've buffed the torp defense considerably to improve the comparatively weak Seraphim sub and to allow them to be used in conjunction with Seraphim destroyers vs T2 subs.

- Torpedo Defense Rate of Fire 0.05 0.2

## Structures

### ![](/assets/images/units/uef/structure/T3MassFabricator.png) Massfabs

T2 and T3 Mass Fabricators have been rebalanced to make T2 Fabs slightly less efficient and T3 a lot more efficient than before.

#### T2 Fab

- Mass Cost: 100 200
- Power Drain: 150 100

#### T3 Fab

- Mass Cost: 3000 4000
- Power Cost: 65000 120000
- Build Time: 4988 5000
- Power Drain: 3500 1500
- Mass Gain: 12 16
- The adjacency bonus for buildings has been buffed to 20% which is the same value as the one we currently have for buildings of the size of a factory. Gateways are an exception. They get a 3.75% bonus which is similar to what you get for ringing the Gateway with T2 Fabricators.

### ![](/assets/images/units/uef/structure/T4SataliteCenter.png)Novax

The novax satellite has been given a decent speed buff and more intel based capabilities to increase it's effectiveness and to give it better abilities as a supportive unit. The cost increase for rebuilding the satellite - which can only be shot down by a strategic missile at the moment - will nerf it as a tool to lock the t4 nuke launcher.

- Speed: 6 9
- Radar Range: 70 150
- Omni Range: 0 50
- Energy Cost: 80000 160000
- Mass Cost: 5000 10000
- Build Time: 15000 30000
