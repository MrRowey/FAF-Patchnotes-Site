Patch 3676

# Patch 3676

#### Date: _March 4th 2017_

The focus of this patch is working on improving the implementation of the previous patch. Cybran regen is improved, Seraphim get a buff to their hps, as well as some smaller changes and fixes.

We wish you good luck and much fun playing with the new patch!

## Air

Janus gets a slight buff again to improve it slightly vs units.

## Structures

### ![](/assets/images/units/cybran/structure/T3NavalHQ.png)T3 Naval Support Factories

T3 naval support facs were found to be too vulnerable considering the cost of the units being constructed within them so we have reduced their hp nerf.

- UEF HP: 13000 <span class="material-symbols-outlined">

  </span> 17000
- Seraphim HP: 10000 <span class="material-symbols-outlined">

### ![](/assets/images/units/uef/structure/T2NavalFacHQ.png)T2 UEF Naval Support Factory

This is a correction of the UEF T2 naval support factory which was missed in testing before the previous balance patch.

- HP: 6000 <span class="material-symbols-outlined">
  arrow_forward
  </span> 6500

### Seraphim Structures

In the HP nerf patch Seraphim were given the same HP as Aeon. However we now decided to buff their HP so that they have more than Aeon, but still less than UEF. Seraphim have less unit choices and are not one of the strongest factions so some buffs are warranted and this also increases faction diversity.

### Seraphim T1 Buildings

### Cybran Structure Regeneration

The initial Cybran regen values were found to be too low to be a relevant feature, so we have increased Cybran regen across the board.

### ![](/assets/images/units/aeon/structure/T1MassStorage.png)Mass Storages

Mass storage hp has been given some hp back, so that it is more in line with their cost.

- UEF HP: 760 <span class="material-symbols-outlined">
  arrow_forward
  </span> 1200
- Seraphim HP: 600 <span class="material-symbols-outlined">

### ![](/assets/images/units/uef/structure/T2Radar.png)T2 Radar

We have reduced the maintenance cost of T2 radars to encourage this intel option in the mid-game.

- T2 Radar energy Maintenance cost: 250 <span class="material-symbols-outlined">
  arrow_forward
  </span> 200

### ![](/assets/images/units/uef/structure/T1Wall.png)Wall segments

- Destroying Wall Segments now grants 0.1 veterancy instead of 1. Killing walls for vet was an abuse which became more prevalent since the wall hp nerf.
