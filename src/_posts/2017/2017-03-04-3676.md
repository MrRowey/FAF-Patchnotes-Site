Patch 3676

# Patch 3676

#### Date: _March 4th 2017_

The focus of this patch is working on improving the implementation of the previous patch. Cybran regen is improved, Seraphim get a buff to their hps, as well as some smaller changes and fixes.

We wish you good luck and much fun playing with the new patch!

### \-- The Balance Team

---

## Air

### ![](/assets/images/units/uef/air/T2FighterBomber.png) Janus

Janus gets a slight buff again to improve it slightly vs units.

- Initial Damage: 15 20
- Total Impact Damage: 300 400
- Total Overall Damage: 1500 1600

## Structures

### ![](/assets/images/units/cybran/structure/T3NavalHQ.png)T3 Naval Support Factories

T3 naval support facs were found to be too vulnerable considering the cost of the units being constructed within them so we have reduced their hp nerf.

- UEF HP: 13000 17000
- Seraphim HP: 10000 15000
- Aeon HP: 10000 13000
- Cybran HP: 8000 11000
- Cybran HP Regeneration: 15 30

### ![](/assets/images/units/uef/structure/T2NavalFacHQ.png)T2 UEF Naval Support Factory

This is a correction of the UEF T2 naval support factory which was missed in testing before the previous balance patch.

- HP: 6000 6500

### Seraphim Structures

In the HP nerf patch Seraphim were given the same HP as Aeon. However we now decided to buff their HP so that they have more than Aeon, but still less than UEF. Seraphim have less unit choices and are not one of the strongest factions so some buffs are warranted and this also increases faction diversity.

### Seraphim T1 Buildings

- Air/Land/Naval Factory HP: 3100 3500
- Power Generator HP: 600 650
- Hydrocarbon Power Plant HP: 1600 1700
- Mass Extractor HP: 600 650
- Wall Segment HP: 2000 2500

### Seraphim T2 Buildings

- Air/Land Factory HQ HP: 6200 7000
- Naval Factory HQ HP: 10000 11000
- Air/Land Support Factory HP: 3100 3500
- Naval Support Factory HP: 5000 5500
- Power Generator/Mass Extractor HP: 1900 2000

### Seraphim T3 Buildings

- Air/Land Factory HQ HP: 12400 14000
- Naval Factory HQ HP: 20000 22000
- Air/Land Support Factory HP: 6200 7000
- Naval Support Factory HP: 10000 15000
- Power Generator/Mass Extractor HP: 6200 7000

### Cybran Structure Regeneration

The initial Cybran regen values were found to be too low to be a relevant feature, so we have increased Cybran regen across the board.

### Cybran T1 Buildings

- Air/Land/Naval Factory: 3 6
- Power Generator/Mass Extractor: 1 2
- Hydrocarbon Power Plant: 1 6
- Wall Segment: 3 6

### Cybran T2 Buildings

- Air/Land Factory HQ Regen: 10 20
- Naval Factory HQ Regen: 15 30

- Air/Land Support Factory Regen: 3 6
- Naval Factory Regen: 6 12

- Power Generator/Mass Extractor Regen: 3 6

### Cybran T3 Buildings

- Land Factory HQ Regen: 20 40
- Air Factory HQ Regen: 20 40
- Naval Factory HQ Regen: 30 60

- Air/Land Support Factory Regen: 10 20
- Naval Factory Regen: 15 30

- Power Generator/Mass Extractor Regen: 10 20

### ![](/assets/images/units/aeon/structure/T1MassStorage.png)Mass Storages

Mass storage hp has been given some hp back, so that it is more in line with their cost.

- UEF HP: 760 1200
- Seraphim HP: 600 1100
- Aeon HP: 600 1000
- Cybran HP: 500 800
- Cybran HP Regeneration: 1 4

### ![](/assets/images/units/uef/structure/T2Radar.png)T2 Radar

We have reduced the maintenance cost of T2 radars to encourage this intel option in the mid-game.

- T2 Radar energy Maintenance cost: 250 200

### ![](/assets/images/units/uef/structure/T1Wall.png)Wall segments

- Destroying Wall Segments now grants 0.1 veterancy instead of 1. Killing walls for vet was an abuse which became more prevalent since the wall hp nerf.
