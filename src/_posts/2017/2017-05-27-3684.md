## Land

### ![](/assets/images/units/aeon/land/T1Tank.png)Aurora

Aurora now shoot a bit less accurately while moving to reduce their effectiveness while kiting.

- FiringRandomnessWhileMoving: 0.1 0.3

### ![](/assets/images/units/uef/land/T2MobileML.png)Mobile Missile Launchers

The mobile missile launchers of Aeon, Seraphim and UEF are buffed to bring them closer in strength to Cybran MMLs. The MMLs are also given different traits to distinguish them from each other. UEF fires in volleys of three. Aeon missiles have 2 hp but travel much slower. Sera missiles fly faster.

### Aeon

Missile:

- Health: 1 2
- MaxSpeed: 12 8
- Acceleration: 3 2
- InitialSpeed: 3 2

### UEF

- RoF: 0.2 0.1

### ![](/assets/images/units/uef/land/T2FieldEngie.png)Sparky

Reintroduced power drain on Sparkies since the bug that did prevent units with power drain from supporting other units has been fixed.

- Energy Maintenance cost: 0 15

### ![](/assets/images/units/aeon/land/T3Tank.png)Harbinger

Increase Harbinger BuildRate to compensate for the global reduced reclaim speed.

- BuildRate: 3 5

## Air

### ![](/assets/images/units/uef/air/T2FighterBomber.png)Janus

A Janus damage miscalculation is corrected. There was also a very abusable bug which has been found and now fixed.

- DoT Pulses: 15 10
- Fixed a bug that made cluster bombs gain a new target halfway through a run.

### ![](/assets/images/units/uef/air/T1Bommber.png)Scorcher

The UEF t1 bomber gets an increase in the burn time of its bombs to stop it from regularly one shotting t1 tanks that are moving.

- DoTTime: 1.5 4.2

## Structures

### ![](/assets/images/units/aeon/structure/T2Flack.png)Static Flak

Static flak is buffed to allow it to hit T3 Air units more regularly.

Aeon

UEF

- Muzzle Velocity: 25 35

Seraphim

- Muzzle Velocity: 25 35

- AoE: 3 4

Cybran

- Muzzle Velocity: 20 30

### Factory HPs

Factory HPs are being overhauled to some degree once again, and hopefully for the last time in the near future. Naval factory HPs are the main focus here. Given that navy is a more expensive and generally powerful arena than land or air on a given tech level, it has had some of its hp restored. HP values have also been realigned to make them very easy to learn should you feel the need to, to make predicting the number of units needed to snipe a factory much easier.

## ACU

### ![](/assets/images/Enhancements/sera/aoe.png)Refracting Chronotron Amplifier

The Seraphim second gun is one of the rarest upgrades, many players have never even seen it used in a game. We are buffing it with increased damage and AoE, while increasing the mass cost and decreasing the energy cost to keep it as a very powerful lategame option for an aggressive acu and even tele-sniping.

- Mass cost: 3500 4800
- Energy cost: 300000 270000
- AOE: 2 2.7
- Additional damage: 400 750

### ![](/assets/images/Enhancements/aeon/shield.png)Personal Shield Generator

Since the Aeon Personal Shield Generator was reworked in 3662, it was found that the recharge time of the shield was too low. The recharge time is increased to 1 minute 30 seconds.

- ShieldRechargeTime: 65 90

### ![](/assets/images/units/cybran/land/T4Mega.png)Megalith

Megalith build power is reduced and the megalith eggs' build time is also reduced to nerf the Megalith's ability to reclaim at a very high rate.

- BuildRate: 180 45
- Egg BuildTimes reduced by 50%

### Satellite

Satellite crash damage is reduced to deter ctrl-k abuse.

- Crash Damage: 3000 1000
