            <h3>Reduce the maximum attack radius of the Aeon Tactical Missile Defense (TMD).</h3>
            <p>The Volcano could try to intercept missiles that it would never be able to. Given that TMDs try not to overshoot their target, the behavior would cause other TMDs to ignore the missile.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="Card">
            <h3>Fix a bug where the shared armies lobby option does not take into account random spawn positions.</h3>
            <p>As a result, the 'shared' armies would be scattered across the map.</p>
          </div>

              <li>Fix the Shard being able to evade beams.</li>
              <li>Fix air units losing essentially all water vision once they have landed once.</li>

          </div>

            <p>You can now assist a radar to start an upgrade. Requires some adjacency for a tech 2 radar.</p>
            <p>You can enable/disable the behavior at the 'Commands' header of the 'Gameplay' tab of the game options.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="Card">
            <ul>
              <li>Wrecks now warp back onto the map when units crash outside of the map</li>

          </div>

            <h3>Add a silo hatch animation to the UEF ACU when it fires a missile.</h3>
            <p>There's a standard reload time that applies. This is most notable for the Billy. The hatch animation acts as a rough indication for this reload time.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="Card">
            <h3>Rework the frames per second counter to update less frequently</h3>
