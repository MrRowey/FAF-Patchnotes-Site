            <h3>Rebalance walls</h3>
            <p>With the latest patch, walls now reliably block projectiles, even for units hiding behind them. This can create nearly impenetrable defenses without the need for artillery. In collaboration with the balance team, we have decided to implement the following balance changes for all wall sections:
              <ul>
                <li>Health: X <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i> 500</li>
                <li>Health regeneration: X <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i> 0</li>
                <li>Build time: 20 <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i> 15</li>
                <li>Mass costs: 2 <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i> 3</li>
                <li>Energy costs: 10 <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i> 20</li>
              </ul>

            <h3>Allow engineers to change orientation when done constructing</h3>
            <p>In the recent patch, units no longer automatically rotate towards the optimal rollout point upon completing construction. The old behavior, especially noticeable with large units (e.g., naval units), could be quite awkward. We have decided to make an exception for engineers since an incorrectly oriented engineer at the beginning of the game can significantly slow down your build order, costing valuable seconds.</p>

            <h3>Resolve factory modules (of mobile factories) causing issues with campaign objectives.</h3>
            <p>Factory modules are still part of the objective. It is up to the author of the campaign map to exclude them in the script files if they do not want them to be part of the objective</p>

          <div class="Card">
            <h3>Prevent the 'OnEnterWater' event of projectiles triggering when intersecting with the terrain.</h3>
            <p>This bug was addressed through an assembly patch, which was noticeable due to water splashes appearing on land. This issue was particularly prominent with transports crashing, but it also affected the average projectile, creating small water splashes.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="Card">
            <h3>Rectify a bug where a projectile would intersect with the terrain while there's a unit in between.</h3>
            <p>This bug was fixed through an assembly patch, primarily affecting the Stinger's ability to target specific, smaller units.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="Card">
            <ul>
              <li>Correct Zappers (Cybran TMD) from intercepting the wrong missiles.</li>
              <li>Adjust the walking animation rate of various units.</li>
              <li>Correct the missing energy requirements for Overcharge.</li>
              <li>Conceal the collapse button of the mass fabrication panel via the 'UI_ToggleGamePanels' console command.</li>
              <li>Experimental mobile factories can now be selected even during construction.</li>
              <li>Restore the trail to the projectiles of the AA guns on the Cybran carrier.</li>
              <li>Display the backpack on the UEF ACU when the bubble shield enhancement is installed.</li>
              <li>Correct an edge case that would prevent the Microwave Laser weapon from firing</li>
