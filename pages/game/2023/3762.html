            <h3>Small props and trees are ignored when building</h3>
            <p>You can now build on top of logs, bushes, cacti, (fallen) trees and tree groups. This is a quality-of-life change to prevent your ACU or your engineers from delaying your build order because there is an invisible prop (due to Level of Details (LODs)) 'blocking' your construction site. This can significantly delay the construction. Instead, the before-mentioned props are destroyed when you start the construction.</p>

            <p>To be specific, the following props will still block your construction site:
              <ul>
                <li>Any wreck, regardless of mass value</li>
                <li>Any rock, regardless of mass value</li>
                <li>Any non-tree prop of significant (&gt;= 10) mass value in general</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p>For the next patch, the goal is to allow you to entirely rely on the reclaim overview to manage your expectations of whether the construction site is blocked by props.</p>

            <h3>Do not immediately destroy units of teams that recall</h3>
            <p>There was a suggestion on the forum to be able to review the final game state when a team recalls. With this delay, the units are preserved in the final game state, yet still destroyed when you play FFA-like setups</p>
