          <p>This patch aims to alleviate the most pressing imbalances that have arouse over the past 2 years.</p>
          <p> Notably the dominance of Sniper bots and Titans/Loyalists during the T3 stage, Nukes being extremely oppressive, air T4s and T3 artilleries being rushed without any energy infrastructure and the power distribution in naval warfare being very asymmetric tech wise between factions.</p>
          <p>It also includes 2 mini-reworks, Soul Ripper and Bulwark which hopefully will help those units function better at their intended roles.</p>
          <p>We hope you enjoy this new patch</p>

            <h3><img src="/assets/images/units/aeon/structure/T2LandFactoryHQ.png"> T2 Land</h3>
            <p>T2 land is much slower than T1 and T3 which doesn't allow it to adequately cover the map, raid, and defend against attacks, especially on bigger maps. The meta in team games is to generally either completely skip T2 or go all in. These changes hope to make T2 more viable in team games and 1vs1. Another advantage in increasing the MS of T2 land is how they will interact with Rambo ACUs, especially in 1vs1. Currently, Rambo ACUs are extremely strong and even if you have more army value it's very difficult to press your advantage since if you are the one engaging the enemy gets at least 2-3 OCs for free. With the MS changes it should allow the player with more army to more easily punish the opponent for miss positioning their ACU or being overly aggressive/borderline suicidal.</p>
            <p>Increase of 0.1 Movement Speed to all Flacks, MMLs, Range Bots, and Main battle tanks.</p>
            <p>Rhino gets a buff of 0.2 (and so does Cybran flak) as it's currently comparatively weak to its T2 counterparts and Cybran needs a buff during its T2 stage.</p>
            <p>Hover tanks don't get a movement speed increase as they are already very fast and we don't feel like this change is necessary for them. Perhaps they will get some other small tweaks next patch.</p>

            <h3>Air Experimentals</h3>
            <p>Air experimentals were always extremely cheap in energy cost compared to t3 air. This led to the ability to build air t4’s without any power setup like is required for t3 air and thus became a relatively cheesy way to win games. With this change, the e cost is more streamlined with t3 air.</p>
            <p>We also reduce the crash damage of air T4s. Their ability to kill heavily shielded targets by simply dying and hitting them provided the defending player with little counter-play. They still deal a considerable amount of damage to not break the immersion of the game but these values will be further reduced if deemed necessary.</p>

            </ul>
            <p>In addition to the energy cost nerf the Ahwassa gets a small nerf to its AoE considering its dominance compared to the other air T4s.</p>

            <h4><img src="/assets/images/units/cybran/air/T4Gunship.png">Soul Ripper</h4>
            <p>A decrease of roughly 15% across the board. The goal is to make the SR a more viable option and further establish it as the value over time air experimental. With the lower cost, it will be easier for the player to justify investing in the SR
                and slowly leverage a small-medium advantage he had in the air.</p>
            <p>In addition to the stat changes we also increase the movement speed by 1 and give it 75 hp regen per second.</p>

            </ul>
            <p>The decrease in hp is slightly larger than the decrease in DPS meaning the Soul Ripper will be a bit less tanky but will pack a bigger punch relative to its cost.</p>

          <div id="navyintro" class="Card">
            <h3>About Naval Changes</h3>
            <p>For a long time, Aeon frigates were absolute garbage while their Destroyers were insanely good while Cybran had the exact opposite with OP frigate and weak destroyer. These changes redistribute the power of those factions while retaining the units' unique traits and further enhancing them by adjusting the ranges of the frigate. We hope it will also introduce more micro potential in frigate fights, especially with Cybran vs Aeon.</p>
            <p>Bulwark gets a mini-rework to establish it as a T2 support vessel instead of a unit that is mainly used during the T3 stage with Battle-cruisers and Battleships. This should help UEF's notoriously weak T2 stage while making their T3 one less oppressive.</p>
            <p>However, with the changes to Bulwark UEF Battleships are left out to dry. We are making them slightly less clunky so that hopefully they can dodge at least some shot if you micro them.</p>
            <p>Tempest has been very powerful for a long time and it's getting a well-deserved nerf. It will cost a bit more, and you will need more BP/infrastructure ready to build one. It won't be able to act like a quick mass dump after spamming destroyers and skipping T3 Navy completely.</p>

This was necessary due to how weak the Aeon frigate was but this kind of balance made Aeon really bad at T1 and extremely oppressive at T2 where they spammed destroyers only. With the buffs to their frigate, we can finally tune down Exodus a bit. We are reducing its HP to punish Aeon players for letting their destroyers get into range of their enemy and reducing the max range down to 70 to allow shorter-range destroyers to get into range more easily. This will also mean that the Cybran destroyer will now out-range the Exodus and thus have some edge over them.</p>

              <h3> Engineers</h3>
              <p>Engineer pathfinding is one of the most frustrating things in FAF. With the changes to their Turn rate, Back up distance, and Acceleration/Deaccelaration we hope to finally alleviate those issues. These changes will also make engineers more micro'able, especially in the early stages of the game eg. vs T1 bombers. If you want to read more take a look at this <a href="https://github.com/FAForever/fa/pull/4571">PR</a> that Jip made.</p>
              <p>We are also buffing the efficiency of higher-tech engineers. They will now get more bp while having the same cost.</p>
              <ul>
                  <li>T1 Engineer: 10.4 Mass/bp</li>
                  <li>T2 Engineer: 10 Mass/bp</li>
                  <li>T3 Engineer: 9.6 Mass/bp</li>

              <h4><img src="/assets/images/units/uef/land/T2FieldEngie.png"> Sparky (UEF T2 Field Engineer)</h4>
              <ul>
                  <li>Allow Sparkies to build intelligence structures(radars, sonars, stealth generators)</li>
                  <li>Allow Sparkies to build T1 factories</li>
              </ul>
              <p>This small buff should make Sparkies easier and nicer to use by not requiring players to find the nearest T1 engineer on the frontline to construct a radar or a factory. We hope these changes will encourage more aggressive usage of the Sparky on the frontline and in drops.</p>

              <h3>Hives &amp; Kennels</h3>
              <p>Hives have been the dominant engineer station forever now, they have many advantages over Kennels and are extremely dominant in the super-late game. These changes are meant to bring the Hives more in line with the Kennels without making them a non-viable option if you quickly want some concentrated, albeit less efficient, bp in your base in the mid to early late-game.</p>
              <p>Hives will now get less efficient the higher tech of the Hive you get, this is meant to reduce their strength as an insanely compact, high bp that is easy to shield. You will now have to pay more to have a more concentrated, higher HP, higher range BP.</p>
              <p>We are also reducing the HP of engineering stations to make them a bit easier to snipe and to emphasize protecting your BP more.</p>

              <h3>Nukes</h3>
              <p>Nukes are extremely strong and can be very oppressive, especially in team games. In almost every game in an early late-game, it's a good idea to make a nuke. Its relatively low cost combined with having potential for game-ending damage while always being able to find value even if the enemy has adequate defences in place makes it a no-brainer. Not to mention that it will force out SMDs, and not just 1, depending on the map it can be up to 4 which already makes the nuke worth it without even killing anything.</p>
              <p>The small mass cost increase and higher energy cost are supposed to make it more expensive and delay the 1st nuke by requiring more E infrastructure to set up. You will no longer be able to get T3, make 2 T3 power generators, and a nuke launcher immediately afterward. Additionally, the E cost of the missile itself is increased (The Launcher will now drain 5k instead of 4.5k E/sec), this will also increase the importance of adjacency while discouraging heavy assisting.</p>
