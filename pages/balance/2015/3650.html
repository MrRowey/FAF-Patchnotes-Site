            <p>It's been a while since the last balance patch, but after the restructuring of FAF and the establishment of the new council of setons, a balance team is now finally in place. We wanted to release a patch that solves the biggest and most widely accepted problems as fast as possible to make sure you can already have more fun with the game while we are working on the next changes. Some of the problems are a fairly complex, and to completely solve them without delaying the patch or creating new problems was not possible, but we put some changes in place that should tone them down until we can solve them for good.</p>
            <p>In addition we fixed a few of the more difficult remaining bugs as much as possible: Hitboxes for SCUs and the drop behavior of torpedo bombers.</p>
            <p>We worked hard to improve your gaming experience with FA and hope you'll enjoy playing with the new patch even more than before. </p>
            <p>Thanks to the testing team, the coding team and everyone else who helped testing or made suggestions and ideas in the forums.</p>

                <h3>Hover tanks</h3>
                <p>The advantage of hoverunits is their great flexibility, enabling them to be used both on water and on land. However if they are so effective that even pure naval units have significant trouble with large amounts of hoverunits, something is wrong. Furthermore their fast speed makes it unreasonably tiresome to defend against them on raiding-vulnerable island maps. Their build time has been increased, and their movement speed while on water has been decreased.</p>

                    Harbingers are a complicated unit, while being immensely dominant in the early t3 stages, they already lose in bigger numbers to other t3 tanks. Straight out nerfing them would not only lower their early game advantage (and the very satisfying feeling of the unit) but also cause potential problems in the lategame. Increasing the build time to the same mass/BT ratio of Percivals and Bricks will make it harder to produce many Harbinger too early and will give the opponent more time to bring their own counters in place, but should not hurt Aeon too much later. 
                    <br><br>
                    The problems behind the power of the Harbinger lie deeper than this, but it will require more time to solve them. Until then, this change should make the life of non-aeons a little bit easier.

                    <h3>SCUs</h3>
                    After years in uselessness, SCUs became a unit worth to build in previous FAF patches - probably too much. We improved issues with the hitbox that made SCUs hard and sometimes impossible to hit and fine-tuned some of the upgrades that were simply too strong. Another advantage they had over normal units was the lack of reclaim you would get for destroying them inside your territory. They will now leave wreckage like other units, but be careful; multiple SCUs might just reclaim the leftovers of their comrades, but at least they can't shoot while doing so, giving you time to destroy them before they steal your mass or get a second line of defense up. To make it easier to get RAS SCUs on the field, RAS presets have been added. 
        
                    <p>More changes to SCUs might come in the future that help to define their role better (or decide what this role should be), but until it is decided if this is necessary, reducing their strength can’t be a bad idea. </p>

                Once your UEF opponent reaches the t3 stage, you are playing against a time-bomb. As UEF pays for this with a weak t2 navy, there is nothing wrong with this, except that this time-bomb is ticking a bit too fast. Making the main reason for the UEF dominance more expensive will give other factions more time to beat them before they are able to gather a critical mass of battleships that can use their range in combination with their great support units to dominate the sea.

                We wanted to keep Cybran's advantage of killing targets next to TMDs with several missiles, which is a compensation for their weak defense. However, this should not allow the Cybran player to easily take out the TMD itself with the unit that they are supposed to counter. We are adding a special armor-type against cybran missiles to TMDs, allowing them to survive a single missile with low hp. This means that sooner or later you will still need two of them to be completely safe, but you will have more time to get them (or repair the damaged one after a failed attempt to kill it), and it will take double the effort and resources to take the ones out you have.

                Team killing or intentionally inflicting damage to teammates is not only rude towards the target, but often ruins the game for all other teammates and opponents too. That's why it is, among with offensive language, a bannable offense in FAF and should be reported to the moderators. We are going to make it harder to get banned by removing the most popular and easiest tool for team killing, giving you the opportunity to calm down and think about if punishing this guy for his behavior or skill is really worth risking a ban and ruining a game for everyone.
